Packages are build without a setup.py, and source only, as any PIP recent enough will be PEP517 compliant.
Flit is the simplest packaging tool that will work. Read about it here https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cmdline.html.

Getting Ready to Publish a Package.
9
Get your credentials for pypi and testpypi and add them to your ~\.pypirc.  ~\.pypirc
seems very finicky even though it looks like a text file.  If publishing to pypi or testpypi is
new it is suggested you copy pypirc_template to ~/.pypirc and add your token from your accounts for PyPi/TestPyPi.
(see in the natlink repository for this template)
 
Customizing the Package for PyPi:

Read https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html  to see how to customize the description on PyPi,
licensing, etc.   
 
To build a package:

Ensure you have flit ("pip install flit")

Update the version number of the package.  Make the number bigger in src/unimacro/__init__.py than it was the last time
a package was uploaded to TestPypi or PyPi.  Flit uses that number as the release number on pypi.

Start a power shell in the root of your git clone.  if you are used to command shell, type "powershell" and that 
will launch a windows powershell.  

enter the command "build-package".   That should work.  if you have untraccked git files you need to 
address them by addding to .gitignore or adding to git.


To test  a package.

If that works, and you want to see if it works, i suggest uploading to testpypi.
use the powershell command:

publish_package_testpypi

if it publishes, then you will see the updated version number in natlink on testpypi https://test.pypi.org/search/?q=natlink

Now install it using pip with this:

pip --no-cache install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple  unimacro

Remove any local projects for natlink from any Python Path variables, so that the version in site-packages gets loaded by
natlink.  You can rename your dictation-toolbox root temporarily below which natlink lies, or your can temporarily rename
natlink to something like dev_natlink.
 
 

To Publish a Package on PyPi after testing.

You can't undo publishing a package on PyPi, so get it working on TestPyPi first.

Then publish to testpypi using publish_package_pypy in powershell.
