------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file contains the documentation for the natlink Python extension
module.  This extension module provides a thin wrapper around various
functions in the Dragon NaturallySpeaking extended SAPI interface.  

playString( keys, flags )
    This is a utility function which will send a series of keystrokes to the
    window with the focus.  The passed parameter is a string in standard
    Dragon NaturallySpeaking format (control sequences in braces).  This 
    function will not return until the last keystroke has been drained from 
    the input queue.

    The second parameter is optional.  It is a combination of one or more
    of the following flags:
        0x01        # add SHIFT to the first character in the string
        0x02        # add ALT to the first character in the string
        0x04        # add CTRL to the first character in the string
        0x08        # add RIGHT SHIFT to the first character in the string
        0x10        # add RIGHT ALT to the first character in the string
        0x20        # add RIGHT CTRL to the first character in the string
        0x40        # use the extended keyboard version of the first char
        0x100        # set this to defer the termination of the playStrings
                        operation until the system is sure that the event queue
                        has been drained.  This works around a Win95 problem. 
        0x200        # set to send system keys, uses low-level keyboard hook
        0x400        # when set, an exception will be raises if the user is
                        holding in a shift key during the playString.  This
                        flag is highly recommended when sending system keys.
        0x10000        # use scan codes when generating events
        0x20000        # uppercase the entire string
        0x40000        # lowercase the entire string
        0x80000        # uppercase the first character in the string
        
getLastPlayString()
    This function will recall the string last played by the playString() function.
    It can be used to write post processing macros which will act on the last
    thing that Natlink did.

displayText( text, isError, logText )
    Natlink will create a window in which the user can display messages. 
    Call this function to append a message to that window, displaying the
    window is necessary.  The second parameter will cause the text to be
    displayed in red instead of black.  The third parameter (if 1) will
    also copy the text to the dragon.log file.  

    This function is useful for    redirecting stdout and stderr.  

    Note: this function does nothing unless NatLink is running as a command
    and control subsystem for NatSpeak.

getClipboard()
    Returns a string which represents the current contents of the clipboard
    in text form.  The string will be empty if there is no text in the
    clipboard.

    This function is useful for testing NatLink itself.

getCurrentModule()
    This function returns a tuple which contains information about the current
    module and window which is active.  The tuple contains: 
        (1) the full file name of the module with the path and extension,
        (2) the title of the currently active window, 
        (3) the handle of the currently active window as an integer.

    In the event that the current module name can not be determines, the
    getCurrentModule function will return the tuple ("","",0) instead of
    raising an exception.

getCurrentUser()
    This function will return a tuple of information about the current user
    (set of speech files) for Dragon NaturallySpeaking.  The tuple contains
        (1) the name of the user, 
        (2) a full directory path where the user's speech files are
            located.  If no user is loaded, the name of the user will be an
            empty string.

getMicState()
    This function returns the microphone state, which can be one of 'off',
    'on', 'disabled' and 'sleeping'. 

setMicState( newState )
    Use this function to change the microphone state.  You can pass in
    'off' to turn the microphone off, 'on' to turn the microphone on (which
    takes NatSpeak out of the sleeping state), or 'sleeping' to put NatSpeak
    in the sleeping state.

    Raised ValueError if the newState is not one of the indicated strings.

execScript( command, args, comment )
    This function can be used to execute an arbitrary script using Dragon
    NaturallySpeakings built-in script language.  The second parameter is 
    optional and is a list of strings which represents the words which should
    be matched to _arg1, _arg2, etc. in the script.  The third parameter is
    also optional and represents a comment which is displayed in an error
    messages if the script fails.  Usually you pass in the command name.

    Raises SyntaxError is there is a syntax error in the script.

getCallbackDepth()
    This function was primarily designed as a support function for the
    natlinkmain module.  This function returns an integer which indicates
    how many nested callbacks are active.  It returns 0 when you are not
    in a callback (for example, during initialization of natlinkmain).  For
    a basic callback it returns 1 but if you call back into natlink from
    a callback causing a nested callback to happen (for example, you call
    recognitionMimic) then the callback nesting may be greater than 1.

recognitionMimic( words )
    This function simulates the effect of a recognition.  You pass in an
    array of words which represent the recognition results and NatSpeak
    then simulates the exact effect of having recognized that array of words.
    You will get an error if you pass in words which are unknown or if the
    array of words represents an impossible recognition given the current
    system state.

    Can raise MimicFailed if the phrase to be recognized is not legal in
        the current context (not in an active grammar).  You also get this
        exception if a word in the input list was invalid.

playEvents( events )
    This function is a more powerful version of playString which can play
    any sequence of events.  You pass in a list of events to play where each
    event is a tuple of message, wParam and lParam as defined by windows.
    The following tuples are supported:
        (0x100, keycode, repeat)    # wm_keydown
        (0x101, keycode, repeat)    # wm_keyup
        (0x104, keycode, repeat)    # wm_syskeydown
        (0x105, keycode, repeat)    # wm_syskeyup
        (0x200, x, y)               # wm_mousemove
        (0x201, x, y)               # wm_lbuttondown
        (0x202, x, y)               # wm_lbuttonup
        (0x203, x, y)               # wm_lbuttondblclk
        (0x204, x, y)               # wm_rbuttondown
        (0x205, x, y)               # wm_rbuttonup
        (0x206, x, y)               # wm_rbuttondblclk
        (0x207, x, y)               # wm_mbuttondown
        (0x208, x, y)               # wm_mbuttonup
        (0x209, x, y)               # wm_mbuttondblclk

getCursorPos()
    Returns a tuple with the x and y coordinates of the current position of
    the mouse on the screen.  (0,0) is the upper left corner of the screen.

getScreenSize()
    Returns a tuple with the x and y size of the full screen in pixels.  This
    value can be used to make sure that the cursor remains on the screen.
    
inputFromFile( fileName, realtime, playlist, uttDetect )
    This function will caused Dragon NaturallySpeaking to take its input from
    a wave file with the indicated filename.  The realtime flag is optional 
    and if true (integer 1) it will cause the playback to be slowed down to
    simulate realtime recognition.

    The playlist is optional and represents a list of utterances
    (zero-based) to play from the file.  The playlist is only valid for
    UTT, UTD and NWV files.  It is not valid for WAV files.  For WAV
    files, utterance detection will be used to separate the utterances (all
    other files are assumed to have already been separated into
    utterances).  The play list can contain a mixture of single integers and
    ranges represented as tuples of start and ending integers.

    Warning: because of a bug in NatSpeak, this code can not handle the 
    error if you specify an utterance number in the playlist which is not
    present in the input file.  If that happens you will get a NatSpeak
    SDAPI error and this function will not return.  The only way to recover
    from this error will be to end the Python and NatSpeak processes.

	The defatly behavior of inputFromFile is to perform utterance 
	detection (split speek at pauses) when using files with an extension
	of .wav and not perform utterance detection for other file extensions.
	You can override this default behavior by setting uttDetect.  Setting
	uttDetect to 1 forces utterance detection and setting uttDetect to 0
	disables utterance detection.  The default value is -1.

    Raises ValueError is the file is missing or has an unsupported
        extension.

setTimerCallback( pCallback, nMilliseconds )
    Pass in the address of a Python function which will automatically be 
    called every N milliseconds.  The callback function will not be passed
    any parameters.  Reset the timer by passing in a function of None.

getTrainingMode()
    Returns information about the current training mode.  If no special 
    training mode is active then None is returned.  Otherwise, we return
    a tuple of the current training mode (one of 'calibrate', 'shorttrain', 
    'longtrain', and 'batchadapt') and the total number of milliseconds
    of speech accepted for training so far.

startTraining( mode )
    Initiates a special training mode.  The possible training modes are:
    'calibrate', 'shorttrain', 'longtrain' and 'batchadapt'.

    To perform training (in any training mode), you need to first call
    setTraining.  Then you need to call the correction method for a series
    of previously recognized result objects (ResObj).  Finally, after
    calling correction for each of the results objects you need to call
    finishTraining.

    To train a new user from scratch, you need to use the 'calibrate' special
    training mode on 5-10 utterances.  Then you need to use either the 
    'shorttrain' or 'longtrain' special training mode.  Short training is
    appropiate when using BestMatch III models and requires training of
    at least 3 minutes of speech.  Long training is appropiate for normal
    models or the original BestMatch models and requires training of at least
    18 minutes of speech.

    The third step is to use the 'batchadapt' special training mode. 
    Usually you retrain the same utterances in 'batchadapt' mode that you
    trained in 'shorttrain' or 'longtrain' mode but this is not a requirement.
    There is no lower limit for the number of utterances trained using
    'batchadapt' mode.

    Once a user has been trained it is no longer legal to use the 
    'calibrate', 'shorttrain' or 'longtrain' special training modes on that
    user.  However, it is legal to perform additional training using the
    'batchadapt' special training mode as many times as desired.

    Can raise WrongState you try to set any batch training mode when 
        calibration has not been done or you try to set calibrate mode if
        calibration has already been done.  Also if you try to set any 
        training mode when the system is not in normal training mode.
    Can raise ValueError if the mode is not of the listed strings.
    
finishTraining( bProcess )
    Terminates a special training mode.  With no parameter, or a parameter
    of 1, calling finishTraining will perform the actual training operation.
    This may take a while.  With a parameter of 0, no training is performed
    but the special training mode is cancelled.

    Can raise WrongState if a special training mode is not active.

createUser( userName, baseModel, baseTopic )
    This call create a new user (NatSpeak speaker profile).  The userName
    is a required string.  The baseModel is an optional string.  If 
    specified it should be the name of one of the build-in base models
    (for example: "BestMatch Model").  You can see a list of known models
    by running NatSpeak and creating a new user.  If missing, the default
    base models will be used.  

    The baseTopic is also an optional string.  If specified it should be
    the name of one of the built-in base topics (for example: "General
    English - BestMatch").  You can see a list of known topics by running
    NatSpeak and creating a new user (Professional Edition only).  If
    missing, the default base topic will be used.  

    Creating a user does not open it.  You need to call openUser separately.

    Raises InvalidWord if the user name is invalid.
    Raises UserExists if the specified user already exists.
    Raises OutOfRange if the specified baseModel or baseTopic does not exist.

openUser( userName )
    This call opens a specified NatSpeak user for recognition.

    Raises UnknownName is the specified user does not exist.

saveUser()
    This call saves any modifications made to the currently open NatSpeak
    user to disk.

getUserTraining()
    Returns a string which describes whether this user has been trained or
    not.  Possible values are: 
        None          (which means no training has been done)
        'calibrate'   (which means only calibration was done)
        'trained'     (which means the user has been trained)

getAllUsers()
    Returns an array of strings of the names of all existing users.

getWordInfo( word, flags )
	Looks a word up in the vocabulary and returns an integer which
	represents the word formatting information.  The word formatting
	information can be 0.  If the word does not exist in the vocabulary then
	None is returned.

	Flags is optional (default value is 0).  If specified, you can combine
	of the	following values:
		1 = consider inactive words (backup dictionary)
		2 = consider active non-dictation words
		4 = case insensitive match

	The returned integer is a bit vector of the following flags:
		0x00000001 - Word was added by the user
		0x00000002 - Internal use only
		0x00000004 - Internal use only
		0x00000008 - Word can not be deleted
		0x00000010 - Normally capitalize the next word (like period)
		0x00000020 - Always capitalize the next word (like Cap Next)
		0x00000040 - Uppercase the next word (like All Caps Next)
		0x00000080 - Lowercase the next word (like No Caps Next)
		0x00000100 - No space following this word (like left paren)
		0x00000200 - Two spaces following this word (like period)
		0x00000400 - No spaces between words with this flag set (like with numbers)
		0x00000800 - Turn capitalization mode on (like Caps On)
		0x00001000 - Turn uppercase mode on (like All Caps On)
		0x00002000 - Turn lowercase mode on (like No Caps On)
		0x00004000 - Turn off spacing between words (like No Space On)
		0x00008000 - Restore normal spacing (like No Space Off)
		0x00010000 - Internal use only
		0x00020000 - Suppress after a word which ends in a period (like period after elipsis)
		0x00040000 - Do not apply formatting to this word (like Cap)
		0x00080000 - Do not reset the spacing state (like Cap)
		0x00100000 - Do not reset the capitalization state (like close quote)
		0x00200000 - No space preceeding this word (like comma)
		0x00400000 - Restore normal capitalization (like Caps Off)
		0x00800000 - Follow this word with one new line characters (like New-Line)
		0x01000000 - Follow this word with two new line characters (like New-Paragraph)
		0x02000000 - Do not capitalize this word in a title (like and)
		0x04000000 - Internal use only
		0x08000000 - Add an extra space following this word (like space-bar)
		0x10000000 - Internal use only
		0x20000000 - Internal use only
		0x40000000 - Word was added by the vocabulary builder.

	Raises InvalidWord if the word is invalid.
	Raises ValueError if the flags are invalid.

deleteWord( word )
	Removes a word from the active vocabulary.  The word will still be in 
	the backup dictionary.

	Raises InvalidWord if the word is invalid.
	Raises UnknownName if the word is not in the active vocabulary.

addWord( word, wordInfo, pronList )
	Adds a word to the active vocabulary.  The word may either be
	completely new or already in the backup dictionary.  The wordInfo is
	optional, if missing it defaults to 0x00000001 (word was added by
	user).  

    The third parameter is an optional pronunciation or list of
	pronunciations for the word using Dragon System's pronunciation
	alphabet.  You can add pronunciations to an existing word using 
	this function but you can not delete pronunciations.

	The function returns 1 if the word is added or a pronunciation is
	passed in.  The function returns 0 if you pass in no pronunciations and
	the word already exists.

	If the function returns 0 then the wordInfo will be ignored.  To change
	the wordInfo of an existing word then you must pass in a pronunciation.
	For example, use the following trick.
		currentProns = natlink.getWordProns( wordName )
		natlink.addWord( wordName, newInfo, currentProns[0] )

	Usage hints:

	- when adding words which are already in the backup dictionary, use a
	wordInfo of 0.  This mimics Dragon NaturallySpeaking's own behavior.
	You can use the getWordInfo function to determine if the word is in the
	backup dictionary.

	- when adding a single compleyelt new word, include the 0x00000001 bit
	in wordInfo.  This marks the word as user added and mimics Dragon
	NaturallySpeaking's own behavior.

	- when adding in lots of words at a time, also set the 0x40000000 bit
	in wordInfo.  This simulates the effect of using the vocabulary builder
	which means that the word will be added with lower frequency.

	Raises InvalidWord if the word is invalid.

setWordInfo( word, wordInfo )
	Changes the wordInfo for a word already in the active vocabulary.

	Raises InvalidWord if the word is invalid.
	Raises UnknownName if the word is not in the active vocabulary.

getWordProns( wordName )
	Returns a list of pronunciations for the given word.  Each pronunciation
	is a string.  Returns None if the word does not exist.

	Raises InvalidWord if the word is invalid.

setTrayIcon( iconName, toolTip, callback )
	This function, provided by Jonathan Epstein, will draw an icon in the
	tray section of the tackbar.  

	Pass in the absolute path to a Windows icon file (.ico) or pass in one
	of the following predefined names: 
		'right', 'right2', 'down', 'down2',
		'left', 'left2', 'up', 'up2', 'nodir' 
	You can also pass in an empty string (or nothing) to remove the tray
	icon.

	The toolTip parameter is optional.  It is the text which is displayed
	as a tooltip when the mouse is over the tray icon.  If missing, a generic
	tooltip is used.

	The callback parameter is optional.  When used, it should be a Python
	function which will be called when a mouse event occurs for the tray
	icon.  The function should take one parameters which is the type of
	mouse event:
		wm_lbuttondown, wm_lbuttonup, wm_lbuttondblclk, wm_rbuttondown, 
		wm_rbuttonup, wm_rbuttondblclk, wm_mbuttondown, wm_mbuttonup, 
		or wm_mbuttondblclk (all defined in natlinkutils)

	Raises ValueError if the iconName is invalid.

These two utility functions were introduced to make it easier to use natlink in
a multithreaded environment.  You are not allowed to make most NatLink calls in
any thread except the main thread of your application.  This is a COM 
restriction more than a NatLink restriction.  However, you can call
postCallbackMessage from any thread.  The callback will be made in the main
thread.

setMessageCallback( pCallback )
    Pass in the address of a Python function to call as a result of a call
    to postMessageCallback.

postMessageCallback( param )
    When you call this function in any thread, a Windows message will be
    posted to the main thread.  Once that message is removed from the message
    queue, a call to the function established by setMessageCallback will be
    made.  The parameter (param) will be passed to the callback function.

The following functions are used in the natlinkmain base module.  You
should only used these if you are control NatSpeak using the NatLink module
instead of using Python as a command and control subsystem for NatSpeak. In
the later case, users programs should probably not use either of these two
functions because they replace the callback used by the natlinkmain module
which could prevent proper module (re)loading and user changes.

setBeginCallBack( pCallback )
    Pass in the address of a Python function to call when the beginning of a
    new recognition is detected.  Dragon NaturallySpeaking will pause all
    recognition processing until the Python function returns.  However, it
    is safe to call other natlink module functions from within the
    Python callback function.

    When a recognition starts, this callback will be made and passed a single
    parameter which is the same tuple which is returned from getCurrentModule.

setChangeCallback( pCallback )
    Pass in the address of a Python function to cal when something in the
    system changes.  When a change occurs, the callback function will be 
    passed two parameters.  The first parameter is a string indicating what
    changed. The second parameter which depends on what changed.

    Active user changes: 'user', same tuple returned from getCurrentUser
    Mic state changes: 'mic', same string returned from getMicState

The following three functions are designed to be used when you have a
Python program which controls NatSpeak by explicitly importing the natlink
module.  Do not use these functions when you are using Python as a command
and control subsystem for NatSpeak.  In that case, these functions are
automatically handled for you.

isNatSpeakRunning()
    Returns 1 is NatSpeak is running and 0 otherwise.  This is the only
    function which can be called before calling natConnect.

natConnect( bUseThreads )
    Connect with Dragon NaturallySpeaking.  This call will launch Dragon
    NaturallySpeaking if NaturallySpeaking is not running.  As a side
    effect of this call, the natlink module will grap a number of COM
    interface pointers into Dragon NaturallySpeaking itself.  Pass in an
    optional boolean to enable thread safety.  This is required when running
    with the Pythonwin code.

natDisconnect()
    Disconnect from NatSpeak by releasing all internal COM interfaces
    pointers.  This will cause Dragon NaturallySpeaking to stop running it
    it was launched by calling connect.

waitForSpeech( timeout )
    The Python program must call this function in order to allow speech to 
    be processed.  This function will enter a standard Windows message loop.
    When speech events occur, the previously established Python callback
    functions will be envoked in a nested call.

    A message box will be displayed if the timeout is zero or positive and the
    waitForSpeech call will not return until this message box is closed or
    until the timeout period (in milliseconds) ends.  A timeout of zero
    suppresses the timeout.  A negative timeout is just like a positive
    timeout except that the message box is not displayed (the function only
    returns when the timeout elapses).

Inside natlink, each grammar is maintained as a separate object.  To expose
this structure, each grammar object will be exposed to Python as a class. 
The GrammarBase class defined in natlinkutils encapusulates and extends the
basic functions of a grammar object.  It is recommended that you use the
GrammarBase class instead of using GramObj directly.  The syntax for
building grammars is documented in gramparser.py.

class GramObj():

    load( binary, allResults=0, hypothesis=0 )
        Before you use a grammar you need to pass in a binary representation
        of the grammar in SAPI format (as a string).  This call actually
        creates the associated COM objects.  

		If you set the optional allResults parameter to 1 then you will be
		able to get a results object even when the recognition is not
		specific to your grammar.

		If you optionally set hypothesis to 1 then partial recognition
		hypothesises will be available during recognition using a hypothesis
		callback (see setHypothesisCallback).

		The first DWORD of the SAPI binary grammar format defines the type
		of grammar.  Command grammars (like those created by GrammarBase
		in natlinkutils) have a type of 0.  Dictation grammars have a type
		of 1.  Not every member function of GramObj is supported by every
		grammar type.

        Can raise InvalidWord if the grammar contains an invalid word.
        Can raise BadGrammar if the grammar specification is in error.

    unload()
        Call this to unload the grammar and delete the associated COM objects.
        This function will automatically be called when the GrammarBase object
        is garbage collected but it can also be called explicitly.

    activate( ruleName, window )
        Call this to activate a named exported rule in the grammar.  You
        can activate multiple exported rules by calling this multiple times.
        Pass in the handle of a window (from getCurrentModule) or 0 for
        a global grammar.

		Pass in an empty ruleName for dictation grammars.

        Can raise UnknownName if ruleName is not defined in the grammar.
        Can raise BadGrammar if the grammar is too complex to be recognized.
        Can raise WrongState if the named rule is already active.
        Can raise BadWindow is the specified window does not exist.

    deactivate( ruleName )
        Call this to deactivate a named exported rule in the grammar.

        Can raise WrongState of the named rule is not currently active.

    setExclusive( state )
        Set the exclusive property on a grammar to force the recognizer
        to limit the recognition to only grammars which are marked as
        exclusive.

    setBeginCallBack( pCallback )
        Pass in the address of a Python function to call when the beginning of 
        a new recognition is detected.  Dragon NaturallySpeaking will pause
        all recognition processing until the Python function returns. 
        However, it is safe to call other natlink module functions from
        within the Python callback function.

        This callback for each grammar object which has been loaded, and after
        the global BeginCallback is made.

        When a recognition starts, this callback will be made and passed a 
        single parameter which is the same tuple which is returned from
        getCurrentModule

    setResultsCallback( pCallback )
        Call this to setup a callback function which will be called when a
        recognition occurs for this grammar object.  Pass the callback
        function.

        When a recognition occurs, the callback function will be called with
        two parameters.  The first parameter is the same list which is returned
        by ResObj.getResults(0).  The second parameter will be a ResObj instance
        which represents the results object.

        If you have set the optional allResults parameter to load() then
        your results callback will also get the results of recognitions
        which were not the result of your grammar.  If a recognition is
        the results of some other grammar in the system then the first
        parameter passed to your callback function will be the string 'other'
        instead of a list of words.  If a recognition corresponds to a 
        system rejection then the first parameter passed to your callback
        function will be 'reject'.

	setHypothesisCallback( pCallback )
		Call this to setup a callback function which will be called during
		the middle of recognitions with the partial hypothesis of the
		recognition in progress.  You must have set the hypothesis
		parameter on load or the callback will not be called.

		The callback routine is passed a list of words representing
		the best recognition hypothesis so far.  The frequency of callbacks
		is determined by Dragon NaturallySpeaking.  Any word in the 
		hypothesis is subject to chang ein the next callback or when the
		recognition completes.

    emptyList( listName )
        This function removes all the words in a named list in the grammar.

        Can raise UnknownName if listName is not defined in the grammar.
		Can raise WrongType is used with dictation grammars.

    appendList( listName, word )
        This function adds a new word (which can be a phrase) to a named list
        defined for the grammar.  You can only append one word at a time.
        Combine this with emptyList to replace the words in a given list.

        Can raise InvalidWord if word list contains an invalid word.
        Can raise UnknownName if listName is not defined in the grammar.
		Can raise WrongType if used with dictation grammars.

	setContext( beforeText, afterText )
		For dictation grammars, this sets the speech recognition context.
		The context is the set of words (passing in at least 2 words is
		suggested) which the recognizer should assume proceed and optionally
		follow the text to be recognized next.  Pass in two strings (the
		strings can be blank) which correspond to text (not words). 
		AfterText is optional and will be assumed to be blank if missing.

		Can raise WrongType if used with command grammars.

	setSelectText( text )
		For SelectXYZ grammars only, this function is used to tell the
		recognition engine what text should be used for the SelectXYZ
		grammar. Pass in the visible text exactly as it appears on the
		screen.	The recognition engine will automatically build the
		grammar.

		Can raise WrongType if used with other than SelectXYZ grammars.

	getSelectText()
		For SelectXYZ grammars only, this function returns the text 
		currently stored in the reocgnition engine for this active
		SelectXYZ grammar.  getText should return the same value stored
		with setText including modifications made by calling changeText.

		Can raise WrongType if used with other than SelectXYZ grammars.


Results are also represented by objects which can be manipulated.  Result
objects are returned as the second parameter to the grammar results callback.

class ResObj():

    getResults( choice )
        Call this to return the recognition results for a given choice
        on the choice list.  Choice 0 (the default) is the actual recognition
        results.  Other choices are alternatives.  Returns None if there
        are no results.

        Normally returns a a list which which represents the recognition
        results.  The list will contain a sequence of tuples. Each tuple
        will be a pair of the word which was recognized and the rule number
        of the innermost rule in the grammar which contains that word.

		Note that the rule number is only signifiant for command grammars.
		For dictation and selection grammars the rule number is always 0.

        Can raise OutOfRange if choice too large for that recognition.

    getWords( choice )
        Just like getResults except that it only returns a list of words not
        rule numbers.  Returns None if there are no results for the given
        choice.  This call is faster that getResults.

        Can raise OutOfRange if choice too large for that recognition.

    correction( words )
        Call this to perform a correction (and adaptation) of a results
        object.  Pass in an array of words which represents what should
        have been recognized (which can be the same as what was recognized).
        This call can also be used when doing batch training.

        Returns 1 if training succeeds and 0 if training fails.  Training
        can fail of the transcription is not close enough to the utterance.
        This is not considered to be a serious enough error to throw an
        exception.

        Can raise InvalidWord if word list contains an invalid word.

    getWave()
        Returns a string which contains binary data which represents the
        wave data for this results object.

        Can raise DataMissing is no wave data is available.

	getWordInfo( choice )
	    Call this to return the recognition results for a given choice
	    on the choice list.  Choice 0 (the default) is the actual recognition
	    results.  Other choices are alternatives.  Returns None if there
	    are no results.

		Returns a list of tuples.  Each tuple contains the following elements:
			wordName - same as returned by ResObj.getChoice
			cfgParse - same as returned by ResObj.getChoice
			wordScore - for the first word of the result, this is the score
				of this choice; lower is better; zero for other words
			startTime - start of word in milliseconds from start of utterance
			endTime - end of word in milliseconds from start of utterance
			engineInfo - integer (actually a DWORD) properties of the word
			wordPron - first pronunciation for the word; not necessarily
				the pronunciation which was recognized

		Multiply startTime and endTime by 11.025 to index into the wave data
		returned by ResObj.getWave

	    Can raise OutOfRange if choice too large for that recognition.

	getSelectInfo( gramObj, choice=0 )
		Only for results from the recognition of a SelectXYZ grammar, this
		function returns a tuple containing information about the SelectXYZ
		recognition.  

		The first parameter should be the grammar object for which you want
		the select info.  The section parameter should be the choice number
		(just like getResults). 

		The returned tuple contains:
			startPos - character position in the text buffer 
				(GramObj.getSelectText) for the start of the selection
			endPos - character position for the end of the selection

		Can raise TypeError is the first parameter is not a GramObj instance.
		Can raise BadGrammar if the result did not come from the grammar.
		Can raise WrongType if used with other than SelectXYZ results.
	    Can raise OutOfRange if choice too large for that recognition.

This is a dictation objectm which encapsulates a complete dictation client. 
With NatSpeak, when you create a window which supports dictation, you
associate that window with one dictation object.  

The dictation object maintains an internal buffer which is an exact copy of
the text in the window.  When the user changes the content of the window by
typing, the dictation object buffer needs to be updated.  When the user
dictates into the window, the dictation object will change its internal
buffer and then make a callback so the window can be updated.

class DictObj():

    activate( window )
        Call this to activate the dictation grammar.  Pass in the handle of a
        window (from getCurrentModule) or 0 for    a global grammar.

        Can raise BadWindow is the specified window does not exist.

    deactivate()
        Call this to deactive the dictation grammar.  It is safe to call
        deactivate even if activate has not been called.

    setBeginCallback( pCallback )
        Pass in the address of a Python function to call when the beginning of 
        a new recognition is detected.  Dragon NaturallySpeaking will pause
        all recognition processing until the Python function returns. 
        However, it is safe to call other natlink module functions from
        within the Python callback function.

        This callback is made before the internal buffer is readied for
        recognition so it is safe to make changes to the internal buffer
        during the callback.

        When a recognition starts, this callback will be made and passed a 
        single parameter which is the same tuple which is returned from
        getCurrentModule

    setChangeCallback( pCallback )
        Pass in the address of a Python function to call when recognition
        happens and the contents of the internal buffer is changed in some
        way. 

        The called function will be passed the following parameters:
        ( delStart, delEnd, text, selStart, selEnd ).  

        delStart,delEnd - define the range of characters in the buffer which
        were replaced by the recognition.

        text - is the string which replaced those charcters.  The length of
        text may be different than end-start.

        selStart,selEnd - is the location of the selection after the the
        recognition.


    The following functions operate on the internal buffer.  To be consistant
    with Python, it is legal to pass in negative values which are offsets
    from the end of the buffer.  It is also legal to leave out the end 
    parameter, in which case the end of the buffer is assumed.

    setLock( state )
        Call this to control the lock on the internal buffer.  setLock(1)
        sets the lock and setLock(0) resets the lock.  Internally the lock
        state is incremented when you set the lock so you need to call
        setLock(0) for every (nested) call to setLock(1).

        Locking the internal buffer guarentees that the state of the buffer
        remains consistant while the lock is held.  You should lock the
        internal buffer before calling any of the following functions.

        Note: NatSpeak requires you to lock the internal buffer before
        any of these calls but to make Python programming easier, this
        module will set the lock for you.  This is ok for a single call,
        but if you make multiple calls, you could get inconsistant 
        information    if you are not protected by a lock around all the 
        calls.  

        Can raise WrongState if you call setLock(0) when no lock is active.

    getLength()
        Returns the length of the text in the internal buffer.  Note that
	    getLength maybe somewhat expensive for large buffers.
        
    setText( text, start, end )
        Changes the text in the internal buffer at the indicated position.
        The length of the region to be changed (end-start) does not have
        to match the length of the text.  This allows text to be inserted
        or deleted.

    getText( start, end )
        Returns a string which represents the text in the internal buffer
        at the indicated position.  The length of the returned string will
        be end-start.

    setTextSel( start, end )
        Changes the current selected region.

    getTextSel()
        Returns the current selected region as a tuple of (start,end).

    setVisibleText( start, end )
        Establishes a subset of the buffer as being the range of visible
        text.  Only visible text can be selected or corrected by voice. 
        Otherwise, the visible text range has no effect on recognition.

        Unlike setTextSel which will coerce the end position to match the
        end of the buffer, if the start position is 0 and the end position
        is missing then the end position will be set to 0x7FFFFFFF rather
        than the length of the buffer.

    getVisibleText()
        Returns the current visible text range which was set by
        setVisibleText. 

        The initial value of the visible text range is 0 - 0x7FFFFFFF 
        which covers the entire buffer.  This ensures that the selection
        commands work even if you do not set the visible text range

About exceptions in NatLink.  NatLink will return exceptions classes for
errors which occur using the NatLink functions.  In order to make it
possible to look for specific errors, there are a number of possible error
classes which can be returned.  All NatLink error classes are derived from
the base class "NatLink.NatError".  The following subclasses are currently
defined.

    NatError
        Base class for all NatLink errors.  This is also returned for 
        unexpected errors which are not common enough to have been converted
        into a more explicit error class.
    InvalidWord
        Raised when a word or named passed into a function is invalid. 
        Usually because the word is too long or uses backslash characters
        improperly.
    UnknownName
        Raised when an unknown rule or list names is passed into a function.
        Also raised when passing an unknown username to openUser.
    OutOfRange
        Raised when accessing a result which is not available, usually 
        because the choice number is too high.  Also raised when an unknown
        base model or base topic is passed to createUser.
    MimicFailed
        Raised when recognitionMimic fails for any reason.
    BadGrammar
        Raised from GramObj.load when the grammar loads for any reason.  Also
        returned from GramObj.activate when the grammar object is too complex
        to be activated.
    WrongState
        Raised when function can not be applied because system is in the wrong
        state.  For example, if you call GramObj.activate on a rule which is
        already active or you call startTraining('calibrate') when the
        speech files have already been calibrated.
    BadWindow
        Raised when passing an invalid window handle to GramObj.activate.
    SyntaxError
        Raised when a script with a syntax error is passed to execScript.    
    UserExists
        Raised when calling createUser when the user already exists.
    ValueError
        Raised when passing an invalid string to setMicState or startTraining.
        Also raised when the file passed to inputFromFile is missing or has
        an unsupported extension.
    DataMissing
        Raised by ResObj.getWave when the wave data is not available.
	WrongType
		Raised by GramObj when you make a function call which is not suppored
		for that grammar type.  For example, GramObj.setContext is only
		supported for dictation grammars; if used on a command grammar this
		exception is raised.
