<p>Vocola is a <font color="#cc0000">vo</font>ice <font color="#cc0000"> co</font>mmand 
  <font color="#cc0000">la</font>nguage -- a language for defining commands to 
  control a computer by voice -- developed for use with <a href="http://www.lhsl.com/naturallyspeaking/">Dragon 
  NaturallySpeaking</a> and implemented using <a href="http://www.synapseadaptive.com/joel/PythonMacroSystem.html">NatLink</a>. 
  While these systems do the heavy lifting, Vocola (pronounced "vo-CO-luh") concentrates 
  on features and ease of use. In particular, Vocola offers the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Easy to use 
    <ul>
      <li>Simple, concise command syntax -- most commands are one-liners </li>
      <li>Easy to view and modify commands </li>
      <li>Changed commands are loaded automatically </li>
      <li>Free, and works with any version of NatSpeak </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Features 
    <ul>
      <li>Create commands which <a href="CapturingDictation.html">capture any 
        dictated words</a></li>
      <li>Use concise <a href="UsingAlternatives.html#NumberRanges">number ranges</a>, 
        <a href="OptionalWords.html">optional words</a>, and <a href="UsingAlternatives.html">inline 
        word lists</a> </li>
      <li>Specify different actions for <a href="SubstitutingActions.html">variable 
        words</a> </li>
      <li>Speak a <a href="CommandSequences.html">continuous sequence of commands</a></li>
      <li>Re-use work with <a href="IncludeStatements.html">include files</a> 
        and <a href="DefiningFunctions.html">user-defined functions</a> </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Familiar syntax 
    <ul>
      <li>Keystroke syntax and built-in functions from Dragon Macro Language </li>
      <li>Grammar syntax similar to NatLink </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p> Here are four voice commands defined in Vocola: </p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc"><tbody><tr><td><tt>
 &nbsp;Copy That = {Ctrl+c};<br><br>
 &nbsp;Copy to NatSpeak = {Ctrl+a}{Ctrl+c} AppBringUp(NatSpeak);&nbsp;<br><br>
 &nbsp;1..40 (Left | Right | Up | Down) = {$2_$1};<br><br>
 &nbsp;Sort by (Date=e | Sender=r | Subject=s) = {Alt+v}o $1;
 </tt></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
 The first is a simple keystroke command -- saying "Copy That" 
sends the keystroke Control-C, which copies the current selection to 
the clipboard. The great majority of commands needed for controlling 
a computer by voice are simple keystroke commands like this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The second command, invoked by saying "Copy to NatSpeak", copies a window 
 of text (Control-A selects all text and Control-C copies it) and brings 
 up the NaturallySpeaking editor (using the built-in function <tt>AppBringUp</tt>
 ).</p>
<p>The third command allows controlling the cursor, by saying for example "3 Left" 
  to move left three characters, or "6 Down" to move down six lines. Spoken words 
  match variable terms on the left and are substituted into the keystroke sequence 
  on the right. For example, when saying "3 Left" the spoken "3" matches the numeric 
  range "<tt>1..40</tt>" and the spoken "Left" matches the alternative set "<tt>(Left 
  | Right | Up | Down)</tt> ". The keystroke sequence "<tt>{Left 3}</tt>" is constructed 
  and sent, and the cursor moves left three characters.</p>
<p>The fourth command allows sorting messages in the Netscape Mailer, by saying 
  "Sort by Date", "Sort by Sender", or "Sort by Subject". The matched word "Date", 
  "Sender", or "Subject", causes the appropriate keystroke "e", "r", or "s" to 
  be inserted into the keystroke sequence.</p>
<p>These and other features are discussed in greater detail in the <a href="LanguageTutorial.html"> 
  Vocola Tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3> Why a New Voice Command Language?</h3>
<p>Existing voice command languages are grafted onto existing programming languages. 
  This means you can program any behavior you want, but you're stuck with the 
  syntactic overhead of the base language. In contrast, Vocola is designed specifically 
  as a voice command language, not as a general-purpose programming language. 
  This means you can write quickly and concisely the great majority of voice commands 
  you need, and use another language in the few cases where you need more power. 
  When I switched to Vocola I was able to convert all but two of my 200+ Dragon 
  macros, and at this writing use something over 900 Vocola commands.</p>
<p>Alternatives to Vocola include NatSpeak Pro's VisualBasic-based language (introduced 
  in version 6), the older Dragon Macro Language (used through version 5 and still 
  functional), and NatLink. Each of these languages has advantages, but (in my 
  humble and not unbiased opinion) none offers Vocola's features and ease of use.</p>

<h2>Using&nbsp;Vocola</h2>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en">

  <title>Using Vocola</title>
   
</head>
  <body>
<p>The easiest way to create and manage Vocola commands is by voice, using Vocola's 
  built-in commands. Beginning and intermediate users should only need to learn 
  the two commands described in the first subsection. The remaining subsections 
  discuss commands for advanced features.</p>
<p>In the command descriptions below, words in square brackets are optional. For 
  example, &quot;Edit [Voice] Commands&quot; means you can say either &quot;Edit 
  Voice Commands&quot; or &quot;Edit Commands&quot;. </p>
<h3>How to Create and Load Voice Commands</h3>
  
<p>With Vocola you can define commands for a specific application program, or 
  define global commands which are active for all applications. You can use the 
  following built-in commands to open the right command files:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"  bordercolor="#FFEECC">
  <tr  bgcolor="#FFEECC"> 
    <td><font color="#660000">When you say</font></td>
    <td><font color="#660000">Vocola will</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tbody>
    <tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"> 
      <td>&quot;Edit [Voice] Commands&quot;</td>
      <td>Open the Vocola file defining commands for the currently running application 
        (using your favorite editor).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"> 
      <td>&quot;Edit Global [Voice] Commands&quot;</td>
      <td>Open the Vocola file defining commands for all applications (using your 
        favorite editor).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>After creating or modifying commands and saving the file, your commands will 
  be loaded automatically and usable immediately. Any errors will be displayed 
  in a pop-up window titled &quot;Messages from Python Macros&quot;.</p>
<h3>Machine-Specific Commands</h3>
<p>If you need to control more than one computer by voice (for example at work 
  and at home) you can define commands which will only be enabled on a particular 
  computer:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"  bordercolor="#FFEECC">
  <tr  bgcolor="#FFEECC"> 
    <td><font color="#660000">When you say</font></td>
    <td><font color="#660000">Vocola will</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tbody>
    <tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"> 
      <td>"Edit Machine [Voice] Commands" </td>
      <td>Open the Vocola file defining commands for the currently running application 
        on the current computer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"> 
      <td>"Edit Global Machine [Voice] Commands"<strong> </strong></td>
      <td>Open the Vocola file defining commands for all applications on the current 
        computer.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Machine-specific command files are also reloaded automatically.</p>
<h3>Direct Loading</h3>
<p>Sometimes it's useful to reload your command files explicitly. For example, 
  if you modify an <a href="IncludeStatements.html">include file</a>, Vocola doesn't 
  know enough to reload all command files which use that include file. You can 
  do it yourself using the following commands:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"  bordercolor="#FFEECC">
  <tr  bgcolor="#FFEECC"> 
    <td><font color="#660000">When you say</font></td>
    <td><font color="#660000">Vocola will</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tbody>
    <tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"> 
      <td>"Load All [Voice] Commands" </td>
      <td>Reload all commands you have defined.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#ffffcc">
      <td>"Load [Voice] Commands"<strong> </strong></td>
      <td>Reload commands for the currently running application.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"> 
      <td>"Load Global [Voice] Commands"<strong> </strong></td>
      <td>Reload global commands.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h3>File Organization and Naming</h3>
  If you don't want to use the built-in commands, or if you want to understand
 the underlying organization they depend on, here are the relevant conventions: 
  
<ul>
  <li> Put all Vocola source files in the folder NatLink/Vocola/Commands.</li>
  <li> Put global commands in the file _vocola.vcl.</li>
  <li> Put application-specific commands in the .vcl file matching the executable 
    name -- for example, commands specific to Netscape.exe go in netscape.vcl.</li>
  <li> You can create additional files for a category of commands by extending 
    the filename.&nbsp; For example, an additional global command file could be 
    called _vocola_text.vcl; or, an additional Netscape command file could be 
    called netscape_addresses.vcl.</li>
  <li> If you want commands to be active only on a certain computer, put them 
    in a file containing @ followed by the computer name.&nbsp; For example, commands 
    in the file natspeak@venus.vcl would be valid only on the computer named "venus" 
    with natspeak.exe running.</li>
  <li>Vocola files are translated into Python files and loaded by NatLink. For 
    example, the Vocola command file NatLink/Vocola/Commands/Netscape.vcl would 
    be translated to the Python file NatLink/MacroSystem/Netscape_vcl.py.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keystroke&nbsp;Commands</h2>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en"><html><head>
                                
  
  
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">


                                
  
  
  <meta name="GENERATOR" content="Mozilla/4.7 [en] (WinNT; I) [Netscape]"><title>Keystroke Commands</title></head><body>
<p>Most of the everyday commands you will need are simple -- "When I say this, 
  send these keystrokes." For example, the following command types the word "Greetings" 
  when you say "Hello World":&nbsp; </p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
<tbody><tr><td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Hello World
   = Greetings;&nbsp;</tt><br>
        <tt><font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Hello World <i><font color="#993366"> 
        &nbsp;Sent:</font></i> Greetings&nbsp;</tt></td>
    </tr></tbody>
</table>
<p>In most cases the keystrokes you want to send will use modifier key sequences 
  to control a particular application. For example, most Windows applications 
  perform a "Copy" operation when you hold down the "Control" key and type the 
  letter "c". The next command uses the phrase "Copy That" to invoke such a "Copy" 
  operation:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc"><tbody><tr><td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Copy That
   = {Ctrl+c};&nbsp;</tt><br>
        <tt><font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Copy That <i><font color="#993366"> 
        &nbsp;Sent: </font></i>{Ctrl+c}</tt></td>
    </tr></tbody></table>
<p>The Vocola syntax for specifying modifier key sequences such as <tt>{Ctrl+c}</tt> 
  is borrowed from the <a href="voicecmd.pdf">Dragon 
  Macro Language</a>, which describes the syntax. &nbsp; </p>
<table cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#ccffff"><tbody><tr><td>Each Vocola command contains a series of <i>terms</i> (indicating
   what  is said) and a series of <i>actions</i> (indicating what is done),
  separated  by "<tt>=</tt>" and terminated by "<tt>;</tt>". In this section
  the terms  are words and the actions are keystrokes; later sections introduce
  other possibilities.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Because Windows applications allow keyboard control of almost everything, you 
  can usually write a keystroke command to do what you want. The next example 
  tells the Netscape 4 mail program to use its HTML editor (rather than the plain 
  text editor) for composing messages:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc"><tbody><tr><td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> HTML Editor
   = "{Alt+e}e{Shift+Tab}{Down 8}{Tab}{Up}{Enter}";&nbsp;</tt><br>
        <tt><font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> HTML Editor <i><font color="#993366"> 
        &nbsp;Sent: </font></i>{Alt+e}e{Shift+Tab}{Down 8}{Tab}{Up}{Enter}</tt></td>
    </tr></tbody></table>
<p>Here's how it works: </p>
<table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><tt>&nbsp;</tt></td><td><tt>{Alt+e}</tt></td><td>Open the "Edit" menu</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td><tt>e</tt></td><td>Choose the "Preferences..." menu item, raising the Preferences
panel</td></tr><tr valign="Top"><td><br></td><td><tt>{Shift+Tab}&nbsp;</tt></td><td>Move back one field in the panel, to the "Category" list</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td><tt>{Down 8}</tt></td><td>Move down 8 lines, to the "Formatting" category</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td><tt>{Tab}</tt></td><td>Move forward one field in the panel, to "Message formatting"</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td><tt>u</tt></td><td>Choose the top radio button ("Use the HTML editor to compose messages")</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td><tt>{Enter}</tt></td><td>Hit the "OK" button</td></tr></tbody></table>
</body></html>

<h2>Quotes&nbsp;And&nbsp;Whitespace</h2>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en"><html><head>
                                
  
  
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">


                                
  
  
  <meta name="GENERATOR" content="Mozilla/4.7 [en] (WinNT; I) [Netscape]"><title>Quotation Marks and White Space</title></head><body>
Quotation marks are optional around keystroke sequences. For example, the following 
commands are equivalent, specifying one action (the keystroke sequence <tt>{Ctrl+a}{Ctrl+c}</tt>):<br>
<blockquote><tt>Copy All = {Ctrl+a}{Ctrl+c};<br>
      Copy All = "{Ctrl+a}{Ctrl+c}";<br>
  Copy All = '{Ctrl+a}{Ctrl+c}';</tt></blockquote>
  
<p>Whitespace (any sequence of blank, tab, and newline characters) is used to 
  separate actions. The following commands are also equivalent, specifying two 
  actions (the keystroke sequence <tt>{Ctrl+a}</tt> followed by the keystroke 
  sequence <tt>{Ctrl+c}</tt>):</p>
  <blockquote><tt>   Copy All = {Ctrl+a} {Ctrl+c};<br>
      Copy All = {Ctrl+a}<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{Ctrl+c};</tt></blockquote>
    <p>In general it does no harm to separate keystroke sequences into multiple 
 actions, so you can add whitespace wherever it is useful in formatting your 
 commands. However, watch out for keystroke sequences containing space characters, 
 such as the "HTML Editor" command above. That command specifies one action:</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p><tt>HTML Editor = "{Alt+e}e{Shift+Tab}{Down 8}{Tab}{Up}{Enter}";</tt></p>
</blockquote>
      <p>Because this command contains a space character, omitting the quotation 
 marks would unintentionally specify two actions, "<tt>{Alt+e}e{Shift+Tab}{Down</tt>"
 followed by "<tt>8}{Tab}{Up}{Enter}</tt>". This command would not behave 
 as intended.</p>
      
<p>An alternative to quotation marks in this example is using the syntax "<tt>{Down_8}</tt>" 
  instead of "<tt>{Down 8}</tt>":</p>
      <blockquote>
  <p><tt>HTML Editor = {Alt+e}e{Shift+Tab}{Down_8}{Tab}{Up}{Enter};</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a Vocola extension to the Dragon Macro Language keystroke syntax -- 
  within braces, underscore may be used instead of space to separate the keystroke 
  name from the repetition count.</p>
<h3><a name="SpecialChars"></a>Some characters must be quoted</h3>
<p>In addition to whitespace characters, the following characters must appear 
  within quotes when used in a keystroke sequence:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><tt>( ) [ ] = | , &quot; '</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All other characters may appear without quotes. For example, pathnames do not 
  need to be quoted, as in this command to open a temporary file:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><tt> Open Temp = {Ctrl+o}C:\Temp\temp.txt{Enter};</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The examples in this tutorial use quotation marks only where necessary; you 
  might prefer to use them more consistently.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Using&nbsp;Alternatives</h2>

  <meta name="GENERATOR" content="Mozilla/4.7 [en] (WinNT; I) [Netscape]">
  <title>Alternatives And References</title>
</head>
  <body>
 Sometimes you will want to create a group of similar commands. Instead of
creating a separate command for each, you can often write a single command
which works for the whole group. 
<p>For example, you might want to be able to say either "Switch View" or "Next
View" to switch between views in an application: <br>
&nbsp; 
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
 <tbody>
    <tr>
 <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> (Switch | Next) View = {Ctrl+Tab};&nbsp;<br>
      <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Switch View <i><font color="#993366">
&nbsp;Sent:</font></i> {Ctrl+Tab}<br>
      <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Next View &nbsp;
&nbsp;<i><font color="#993366">Sent:</font></i> {Ctrl+Tab}</tt></td>
 </tr>
 
  </tbody>
</table>
  </p>
<p>Here the alternative term <tt>(Switch | Next)</tt> allows you to say either. 
</p>
<p>In many cases you want the actions invoked by a command to depend on which
alternative was spoken. For example, you might want to move the cursor in
one of four directions by saying "Move Left", "Move Down", etc.: <br>
&nbsp; 
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
 <tbody>
    <tr>
 <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Move (Left | Right
| Up | Down) = {$1};&nbsp;<br>
      <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Move Left <i><font color="#993366">
&nbsp;Sent:</font></i> {Left}&nbsp;<br>
      <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Move Down <i><font color="#993366">
&nbsp;Sent:</font></i> {Down}&nbsp;</tt></td>
 </tr>
 
  </tbody>
</table>
  </p>
<p>Here the reference "<tt>$1</tt>" specifies that the first variable term should 
  be substituted. So, when you say "Move Left" the value of the first variable 
  term is "Left" and the keystroke"<tt>{Left}</tt>" is sent. <br>
&nbsp; 
<table cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#ccffff">
 <tbody>
    <tr>
 <td>References may appear anywhere in a sequence of actions (i.e. on the
right hand side of an "="), even inside quoted strings. If you want to insert
the literal text "$1", use the escape sequence "<tt>\$1</tt>".<br>
      </td>
 </tr>
 
  </tbody>
</table>
  </p>
<h3><a name="NumberRanges"></a>Number Ranges</h3>
<p>Often you will want to specify a range of numbers as alternatives in a command.&nbsp; 
  This can be specified concisely in Vocola, as in the following example: <br>
  &nbsp; 
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
 <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Move Down 1..10 
        = {Down_$1};&nbsp;<br>
      <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Move Down 1 <i><font color="#993366">
&nbsp;Sent: </font></i>{Down 1}<br>
      <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Move Down 6 <i><font color="#993366">
&nbsp;Sent: </font></i>{Down 6}</tt></td>
 </tr>
 
  </tbody>
</table>
  </p>
<p>Here the syntax "<tt>1..10</tt>" is shorthand for "<tt>(1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10)</tt>
". On the right hand side we substitute the spoken number (e.g. "<tt>6</tt>
") to construct the syntax for a repeated keystroke ("<tt>{Down 6}</tt>") 
and we have a command which moves the cursor down a specified number of lines. 
</p>
<p>In real life it's very useful to control the arrow keys by saying simply 
"1 Down", "3 Left", "6 Up", etc. Here's how to write it in Vocola: <br>
&nbsp; 
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
 <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> 1..40 (Left | 
        Right | Up | Down) = {$2_$1};&nbsp;<br>
      <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> 3 Left&nbsp; <i><font color="#993366">

<p>This command has two variable terms. On the right-hand side the second 
term (which direction to move) is substituted first and the first term (how
many times) is substituted second, to create the necessary keystroke syntax.

  If you want to re-use an alternative set in several different commands, 
you can assign it to a variable. For example, we can create a variable called 
<tt>&lt;direction&gt;</tt> to hold the alternatives "<tt>Left | Right | Up 
| Down</tt>", and use it in a command: <br>
 &nbsp;  
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
     <tr>
  <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> &lt;direction&gt;
 := Left | Right | Up | Down;&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move &lt;direction&gt;
 = {$1};&nbsp;<br>
       <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Move Left <i><font color="#993366">
 &nbsp;Sent:</font></i> {Left}&nbsp;<br>
       <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Move Down &nbsp;<i><font color="#993366">
Sent:</font></i> {Down}&nbsp;</tt></td>
  </tr>
     
  </tbody> 
</table>
    
<p>This command is equivalent to the second command in
the previous section, allowing you to move the cursor in one of four directions. 
 </p>
 
<p>The following command defines the variable <tt>&lt;number&gt;</tt>, and
 is equivalent to the third command in the previous section: <br>
 &nbsp;  
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
     <tr>
  <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> &lt;number&gt; 
:= 1..40;&nbsp;<br>
       <font color="#993366">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
  Move Down &lt;number&gt; = {Down_$1};&nbsp;<br>
       <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Move Down 1 <i><font color="#993366">
 &nbsp; Sent: </font></i>{Down 1}<br>
       <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Move Down 12 <i><font color="#993366">
 &nbsp;Sent: </font></i>{Down 12}</tt></td>
  </tr>
     
  </tbody> 
</table>
   </p>
 
<p>This moves the cursor down a given number of lines.</p>
<p>Finally, we can write our general-purpose arrow-key command (move a given number of steps in any direction) using both
 the <tt>&lt;direction&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;number&gt;</tt> variables: <br>
 &nbsp;  
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">

<h2>Substituting&nbsp;Actions</h2>

<body>
  So far the spoken words in our alternative sets have been substituted directly 
into our keystroke sequences. Actually it is more commonly useful to substitute 
a <i>different</i> set of keystrokes than the spoken words.  
<p>For example, suppose we want "Move Back" to move the cursor left and "Move 
Forward" to move the cursor right. We can specify that this way: <br>
 &nbsp;  
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
     <tr>
  <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Move (Back=Left
 | Forward=Right) = {$1};&nbsp;<br>
       <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Move Back&nbsp;
      <i><font color="#993366">&nbsp; &nbsp; Sent: </font></i>{Left}<br>
       <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Move Forward <i><font color="#993366">
&nbsp; Sent: </font></i>{Right}</tt></td>
  </tr>
     
  </tbody> 
</table>
   </p>
 
<p>The alternative set "<tt>(Back=Left | Forward=Right)</tt>" means you can 
say either "Back" or "Forward", but the value substituted on the right hand 
side will be "<tt>Left</tt>" or "<tt>Right</tt>". </p>
 
<p>Here's another example. The Netscape Mailer has several options for sorting 
messages. This command allows you to change the sort by 
saying "Sort by Date", "Sort by Sender", or "Sort by Subject": <br>
 &nbsp;  
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
     <tr>
  <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Sort by (Date=e
 | Sender=r | Subject=s) = {Alt+v}o $1;&nbsp;<br>
       <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Sort by Date <i><font color="#993366">
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sent:</font></i> {Alt+v}oe&nbsp;<br>
       <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Sort by Sender
&nbsp;<i><font color="#993366"> Sent:</font></i> {Alt+v}or&nbsp;</tt></td>
  </tr>
     
  </tbody> 
</table>
   </p>
 
<p>This alternative set allows you to say "Date", "Sender", or "Subject",
 and substitutes "<tt>e</tt>", "<tt>r</tt>", or "<tt>s</tt>" into the keystroke
 sequence. </p>
 
<p>Another common use of alternative sets with substitution is when you want 
to pick from a long list of specific items such as files, folders, or email 
addresses. For example, we can define the variable <tt>&lt;EmailAddress&gt;</tt>
  to contain a list of email addresses and shorthands to invoke them: <br>
 &nbsp;  
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
     <tr>
  <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> &lt;EmailAddress&gt;
 := ( Bill = bsmith@mediaone.net&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 | Dragon = info@dragonsys.com&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 | Voice Coder = VoiceCoder@yahoogroups.com&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 );&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Address &lt;EmailAddress&gt;
 = $1 {Enter};<br>
       <i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Say:</font></i> Address Bill &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       <i><font color="#993366">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sent: </font></i>bsmith@mediaone.net{Enter}<br>
       <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Address Voice Coder
       <i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Sent:&nbsp;</font></i>VoiceCoder@yahoogroups.com{Enter}</tt></td>
  </tr>
     
  </tbody> 
</table>
   </p>
 
<p>The command "<tt>Address &lt;EmailAddress&gt;</tt>" allows you to say,
 for example, "Address Bill" or "Address Voice Coder" to insert the desired
 email address. The list can be modified over time to add new addresses.
<br>
 &nbsp;  
<table cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#ccffff">

<h2>Capturing&nbsp;Dictation</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want a command which recognizes any words you might say rather 
  than recognizing a particular set of alternatives. For example, searching for 
  text is a common operation in Microsoft Word. It would be nice to be able to 
  speak a single command to search for the text you want rather than needing to 
  speak a command to open the &quot;Find&quot; dialog box, pausing, and then speaking 
  the text you want to search for.</p>
<p>You can use the special variable <tt>&lt;_anything&gt;</tt> in a command to 
  match any spoken words:<br>&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
     <tr>
      <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Find Text &lt;_anything&gt; 
        = {Ctrl+f} $1 {Enter};<br>
        <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Find Text will do<i><font color="#993366"> 
        &nbsp;Sent:</font></i> {Ctrl+f}will do{Enter}&nbsp;</tt></td>
  </tr>
     
  </tbody> 
</table>
    
<p>With this command you could search for the text &quot;will do&quot; by saying 
  &quot;Find Text will do&quot;, which opens the &quot;Find&quot; dialog box, 
  enters the text &quot;will do&quot;, and launches the search.</p>
<p>Note that<tt> &lt;_anything&gt; </tt>matches anything you say, including saying 
  nothing. So in the above example saying &quot;Find Text&quot; would bring up 
  the &quot;Find&quot; dialog box to search for nothing. Since this may be unexpected 
  it's a good idea to use at least two keywords in these commands (i.e.<tt> Find 
  Text &lt;_anything&gt; </tt>instead of<tt> Find &lt;_anything&gt;</tt>) to reduce 
  unwanted recognitions.</p>
<p><tt>&lt;_anything&gt; </tt>may appear anywhere a regular variable term appears, 
  and may even appear more than once in a command.</p>

  <title>Optional Words</title>
</head>
  <body>
 Sometimes you want to create a command with optional words. For example,
you might want to be able to say either "Hit Start Menu" or just "Hit Start"
to bring up the Windows Start Menu: <br>
&nbsp; 
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
 <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Hit Start [Menu] 
        = SendSystemKeys( {Ctrl+Esc} );&nbsp;<br>
      <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Hit Start Menu <i><font color="#993366">
&nbsp;Sent: </font></i>{Ctrl+Esc}<br>
      <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Hit Start&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp;<i><font color="#993366">Sent: </font></i>{Ctrl+Esc}</tt></td>
 </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
  
<p>Enclosing the optional word "Menu" in square brackets does the trick. </p>
<p>Note that optional words are not considered variable terms. Consider this
example: <br>
&nbsp; 
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
 <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> [Move] Down 1..10 
        = {Down_$1};&nbsp;<br>
      <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Move Down 1 <i><font color="#993366">
&nbsp;Sent: </font></i>{Down 1}<br>
      <font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Down 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp;<i><font color="#993366">Sent: </font></i>{Down 6}</tt></td>
 </tr>
 
  </tbody>
</table>
  </p>
<p>Because the optional word "<tt>[Move]</tt>" is not considered variable, 
the range "<tt>1..10</tt>" is the first variable term and is referenced using
"<tt>$1</tt>". <br>
&nbsp; 
<table cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#ccffff">
 <tbody>
    <tr>
 <td>Note that a command must have at least one non-optional term.</td>
 </tr>

<h2>Function&nbsp;Calls</h2>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en"><html><head>
   <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">
   <title>Function Calls</title></head><body>
Not everything can be accomplished with keystroke sequences -- Vocola commands 
can also include calls to <a href="BuiltinFunctions.html">built-in functions</a> 
and <a href="DefiningFunctions.html">user-defined functions</a>. 
<p>Here are two simple examples:</p>
 <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
<tbody><tr>
<td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Die Die = GoToSleep();&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hit Down = ButtonClick(1,1);&nbsp;</tt></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The first example puts NaturallySpeaking in sleep mode when you say
"Die Die". The second example clicks the mouse when you say "Hit Down".
</p><p>The function <tt>HeardWord</tt> is useful for writing a command which
invokes another command. Any command recognized by NaturallySpeaking may
be invoked this way, whether it was defined in Vocola, NatLink, or the
Dragon Macro Language.
</p>
<p>For example, maybe you'd like to say "Kill Word" to delete a word rather than 
  using the built-in NaturallySpeaking command "Delete Next Word", but you don't 
  want to take the time to figure out the exact keystroke sequence. This command 
  does the trick:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
<tbody><tr>
<td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Kill Word = HeardWord(Delete,Next,Word);&nbsp;</tt></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>A command's actions can be a mix of keystroke sequences and function calls. 
  For example, this command performs a "paste" at the current mouse location (saving 
  you a mouse click):</p> 
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
<tbody><tr>
<td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Paste Here = ButtonClick(1,1) {Ctrl+v};&nbsp;</tt></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Function arguments aren't always constant -- you can use a reference to a variable 
  term as an argument to a function call. For example, this command allows you 
  to copy a window's contents to either NaturallySpeaking or Emacs, by saying 
  "Copy to NatSpeak" or "Copy to Emacs":</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
<tbody><tr>
<td><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Copy to (NatSpeak|Emacs)
= {Ctrl+a}{Ctrl+c} AppBringUp($1);&nbsp;</tt></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Here the result of the first variable term "<tt>(NatSpeak|Emacs)</tt>" is passed 
  to the function <tt>AppBringUp</tt> to bring up the desired application. </p>
<p>Finally, a function argument can be built by concatenating more than one action. 
  For example, the &quot;Back&quot; and &quot;Forward&quot; buttons in a Web browser 
  use by convention the keystrokes Alt+Left and Alt+Right. In Lotus Notes these 
  keystrokes only work when passed via the SendSystemKeys function:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
    <tr> 
      <td><p><tt><i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;Vocola:</font></i> Go (Back=Left 
          | Forward=Right) = SendSystemKeys( {Alt+$1} );&nbsp;<br>
          </tt><tt><font color="#993366">&nbsp;<i>Say:</i></font> Go Back<i><font color="#993366"> 
          &nbsp;Sent: </font></i>SendSystemKeys( {Alt+Left} )<i><font color="#993366">&nbsp;</font></i></tt></p>
        </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>When you say &quot;Go Back&quot;, the function argument &quot;{Alt+Left}&quot; 
  is constructed by combining the characters &quot;{Alt+&quot;, the reference 
  $1, and the character &quot;}&quot;</p>

<h2>Defining&nbsp;Functions</h2>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en"><html><head>
   <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">
   <meta name="Author" content="r mohr">
   <meta name="GENERATOR" content="Mozilla/4.7 [en] (WinNT; I) [Netscape]"><title>Function Calls</title></head><body>
<p>Vocola supports user-defined functions as well as built-in functions. If you 
  find yourself copying an action sequence for use in several commands, defining 
  a function can make the commands more concise and understandable. (This is also 
  possible using the built-in function HeardWord, but creating your own function 
  makes for clearer code and faster execution.)</p>
<p>For example, in the Netscape/Mozilla mailer it's useful to define commands 
  to move around in the &quot;summary&quot; window (which shows a one-line summary 
  of each e-mail message). Here we define the function <tt>goToSummary</tt> to 
  make sure the summary window has the focus:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
    <tr> 
      <td><pre>
goToSummary() := 
    SetMousePosition(4, 7)        # Window's bottom left edge
    SetMousePosition(2, 15, -45)  # Bottom left of folder list
    ButtonClick()                 # Folder list now has focus
    {Tab_3};                      # Summary pane now has focus</pre>
	  </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The left side of the definition specifies the function's name (<tt>goToSummary</tt>) 
  and arguments (none in this case). The right side of the definition is a standard 
  Vocola action sequence. Here we position the mouse over the bottom left corner 
  of the mailer window, move up and to the right slightly to be over the folder 
  list panel, click the mouse so the folder list has focus, and finally press 
  the tab key three times so the summary window has focus.</p>
<p>Now we can define 3 commands using this function. Saying &quot;Final Message&quot; 
  moves to the last message in the summary. Saying &quot;First Unread&quot; moves 
  to the first unread message. And saying for example &quot;Summary 3 Up&quot; 
  moves to the summary window and up three messages:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
    <tr> 
      <td><pre>
Final Message = goToSummary() {End};
First Unread  = goToSummary() {End}n;
Summary 1..20 (Up|Down) = goToSummary() {$2_$1};</pre></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Each of these commands uses our function <tt>goToSummary</tt>, making them 
  shorter and clearer than if each had to include that function's actions explicitly.</p>
<h3>Defining Functions with Arguments</h3>
<p>You can also specify arguments when defining a function. For example, here's 
  a function which switches to the nth application on the Windows taskbar:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
    <tr> 
      <td><pre>switchToTaskBar(number) := SendSystemKeys( {Ctrl+Esc} )
                           {Tab_2}{Right_$number}{Left} " ";
</pre></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>This function, <tt>switchToTaskBar</tt>, is defined to take the single argument 
  <tt>number</tt> (indicating which taskbar slot to switch to). <tt>{Ctrl+Esc}</tt> 
  opens the start menu (just to get focus on the taskbar), and <tt>{Tab_2}</tt> 
  moves to the first application. Then <tt>$number</tt> (referring to the function 
  argument) is used to move right the specified number of slots. Finally, sending 
  a &quot;space&quot; keystroke makes the selected application active. (Note that 
  this function works in Windows XP -- a slightly different version is needed 
  for Windows 2000.)</p>
<p>Now we can use this function in several commands. Let's say that Microsoft 
  Word is the third application from the left on the taskbar. Saying &quot;Switch 
  to 3&quot; makes Word the active application. Saying &quot;Close 3&quot; closes 
  Word. And saying &quot;Copy to 3&quot; copies everything from the current application 
  and switches to Word:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
    <tr> 
      <td><pre>&lt;n&gt; := 1..20;
Switch to &lt;n&gt; = switchToTaskBar($1);
Close     &lt;n&gt; = switchToTaskBar($1) {Alt+F4};
Copy to   &lt;n&gt; = {Ctrl+a}{Ctrl+c} switchToTaskBar($1);
</pre></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Each of these commands uses the variable <tt>&lt;n&gt;</tt> to specify a number 
  between 1 and 20, which is then passed to the <tt>switchToTaskBar</tt> function 
  to specify the target application. </p>
<h3>Multiple Arguments and Nested Function Calls</h3>
<p>Here's another example, defining two functions which each take 2 arguments. 
  First is the function <tt>moveBy</tt>, which moves the mouse a distance (x,y) 
  from the current position. Note that it uses the built-in Vocola function <tt>Eval</tt> 
  to multiply each coordinate by 15, providing more convenient units than pixels. 
  (I have rulers taped to my screen in these units, thanks to Kim Patch's idea. 
  With this approach you can place the mouse anywhere on a large screen by speaking 
  only 2-digit numbers, which are recognized much more reliably than 3-digit numbers. 
  See the file <tt>_vocola.vcl</tt> in the shipping Vocola samples for more examples.)</p>
<p><tt>moveBy</tt> is used twice by the next function, <tt>moveWindowBy</tt>, 
  which moves the current window a specified distance (x,y) in these same 15-pixel 
  units.</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
    <tr> 
      <td><pre>moveBy(x,y) := SetMousePosition(2, Eval(15*$x), Eval(15*$y));

moveWindowBy(x,y) :=
    SetMousePosition(4,1)  # Top window edge, center
    moveBy(0,1)            # Down into title bar
    RememberPoint()        # Store initial drag point
    moveBy($x,$y)          # Move by given amount
    DragToPoint();         # Do the drag
</pre></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Note again that a function's arguments may be referenced in its action sequence 
  using &quot;<tt>$</tt>&quot;. That's <tt>$x</tt> and <tt>$y</tt> in these functions.</p>
<p>Now here are two commands using <tt>moveWindowBy</tt>, allowing you to say 
  for example &quot;Window 10 Up&quot;or &quot;Window 20 Right&quot; to move the 
  current window:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
    <tr> 
      <td><pre>&lt;n&gt; := 0..99;
Window &lt;n&gt; (  Up='-' |  Down='+') = moveWindowBy(0, $2$1);
Window &lt;n&gt; (Left='-' | Right='+') = moveWindowBy($2$1, 0);</pre></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Note here how a function argument can be built from two variables. When you 
  say &quot;Window 10 Up&quot;, the first variable term <tt>&lt;n&gt;</tt> has 
  the value &quot;<tt>10</tt>&quot; and the second variable term has the value 
  &quot;<tt>-</tt>&quot;. These are concatenated by the double reference <tt>$2$1</tt> 
  to form the final function call <tt>moveWindowBy(0, -10)</tt>.</p>

<h2>Contextual&nbsp;Commands</h2>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en"><html><head>

  <title>Vocola Tutorial: Enable by Context</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>We've discussed how to create "global" commands (which are always enabled)
as well as application-specific commands (which are enabled only when a particular
application is active). In addition, you can create <i>contextual commands</i>,
which are enabled only when a particular window has the focus.</p>
<p>By specifying all or part of the window title in a <i>context statement
</i>you can create commands specific to that window. For example, here are
three groups of commands for Microsoft Outlook (from the application-specific
command file "<tt>outlook.vcl</tt>"):&nbsp;  </p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
<tbody><tr><td><tt>&nbsp;Microsoft Outlook:<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; New Message = {Ctrl+n};<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Reply to Message = {Ctrl+r};<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Reply to All = {Ctrl+Shift+r};<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Forward Message = {Ctrl+f};<br><br>
 &nbsp;Message (Plain Text):<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Send That = {Alt+s};<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Reply Here = "{Home}{Shift+End}{Del}{Enter 3}{Left 2}";<br><br>
 &nbsp;Calendar:<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; View Month = {Alt+m};<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; View Work Week = {Alt+r};</tt><br></td></tr></tbody>
</table>
<p>The context statement "<tt>Microsoft Outlook:</tt>" specifies that subsequent
commands should be active only when "Microsoft Outlook" is part of the title
of the active window. When reading mail using Outlook the main window title
is "Inbox - Microsoft Outlook", so the first group of commands above (to
create, reply to, or forward a message) will be enabled. </p>
<p>Similarly, when editing a mail message the window title is "Message (Plain
Text)", so the second group of commands above will be enabled. Finally, the
third group of commands above will be enabled when the Outlook calendar is
displayed.</p>
<p>Here is another example. The text editor application Emacs can be customized 
  so that the window title includes the name of the currently-edited file. For 
  example, when editing <tt>iexplore.vcl</tt> (the file of Vocola commands for 
  Internet Explorer) the Emacs window title is "<tt>Emacs - iexplore.vcl - 01.05.02</tt>". 
  This allows defining a set of contextual commands for editing Vocola files. 
  The application-specific command file "<tt>emacs.vcl</tt>" would include:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc"><tbody><tr>
      <td><pre> ### Editing Vocola files
 .vcl:
   Insert             &lt;key&gt; = {$1       Wait(0) }; 
   Insert       &lt;mod&gt; &lt;key&gt; = {$1+$2    Wait(0) }; 
   Insert &lt;mod&gt; &lt;mod&gt; &lt;key&gt; = {$1+$2+$3 Wait(0) }; 
 
 ### Editing Perl files
 .pl:
   New Statement = {Ctrl+e}{Ctrl+j};
   New Statement Above = {Ctrl+a}{Ctrl+b}{Ctrl+j}; 
   Insert Hash Reference = -&gt;{}{Ctrl+b};</pre>
        </td>
    </tr></tbody></table>
<p>So for example when the Emacs window title contains "<tt>.vcl</tt>", saying 
  "Insert Shift Tab" inserts the text &quot;<tt>{Shift+Tab}</tt>&quot; into the 
  file. These commands allow speaking keystroke sequences when writing Vocola 
  code. (The variable definitions for <tt>&lt;mod&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;key&gt;</tt> 
  are omitted here, but available with the Vocola distribution.)</p>
<p>Similarly, the second group of commands above is active only when editing Perl 
  files.</p>
<h3>Global Contextual Commands and Multiple Context Choices</h3>
<p>Contextual commands don't need to be application-specific. You can also create 
  global contextual commands, as in this example from the global command file 
  "<tt>_vocola.vcl</tt>":</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc"><tbody><tr><td><tt>&nbsp;Open:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go Up = ..{Enter};<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Folder List = {Shift+Tab_2}{Down}{PgUp};&nbsp;</tt></td>
    </tr></tbody></table>
<p>This defines two commands for use in a "File Open" dialog box, regardless of 
  the current application. Whenever the window title includes the word "<tt>Open</tt>", 
  you can say "Go Up" to move to the parent folder or &quot;Folder List&quot; 
  to open the folder hierarchy drop down at the top of the dialog. </p>
<p>As it happens, &quot;File Chooser&quot; dialog boxes appear with a wide range 
  of titles, such as &quot;Open File&quot;, &quot;Save As&quot;, &quot;Browse 
  for Folder&quot;, etc. Ideally we want the same set of context-specific commands 
  to be available for all such dialogs. Vocola supports this by allowing the &quot;<tt>|</tt>&quot; 
  character in context statements. Here is the full set of context titles and 
  commands I use:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>

<h2>Include&nbsp;Statements</h2>

   <title>Built-in Functions</title></head><body>
Sometimes you will want to use a set of Vocola definitions in more than one application. 
The Vocola &quot;include&quot; statement allows you to put such shared definitions 
in a single file, and include that file in each of several application-specific 
command files. 
<p>For example, many applications need to navigate the file system to find specific 
  files or folders. But speaking pathnames can be difficult, as can navigating 
  through folder hierarchies by voice. What you'd really like to do is define 
  a single list of shortcuts to interesting folders, and have that list available 
  in any program which needs to navigate the file system. </p>
<p>I've created a file called &quot;folders.vch&quot; (&quot;vch&quot; stands 
  for &quot;Vocola header&quot;) to contain my personal list of interesting folders, 
  defined as a Vocola variable:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
    <tr> 
      <td><tt><i><font color="#993366">From file folders.vch:</font></i></tt> 
        <pre>&lt;folder&gt; := <br> ( Home       = C:\Rick<br> | Temp       = C:\Temp<br> | Downloads  = C:\Programs\Downloads<br> | Start Menu =&quot;C:\Documents and Settings\Rick Mohr\Start Menu&quot;<br> | Vocola     = C:\Programs\NatLink\Vocola<br> | NatLink    = C:\Programs\NatLink\MacroSystem<br> );</pre></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>With the Vocola &quot;include&quot; statement this list can be used in several 
  Vocola command files. Here's part of my command file for Windows Explorer:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
    <tr> 
      <td><p><tt><i><font color="#993366">From file explorer.vcl:</font></i></tt></p>
        <tt>include folders.vch;<br>
        Folder &lt;folder&gt; = {Alt+d} $1 {Enter}{Tab_2};</tt></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>So for example, saying &quot;Folder NatLink&quot; to Windows Explorer switches 
  to the folder &quot;C:\Programs\NatLink\MacroSystem&quot;.</p>
<p>The folder list is also useful in a Command Prompt (DOS box), where saying 
  for example &quot;Folder Temp&quot; performs the command &quot;cd C:\Temp&quot;:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
    <tr> 
      <td><p><i><font color="#993366"><tt>From file ntvdm.vcl:</tt></font></i></p>
        <tt> include folders.vch;<br>
        Folder &lt;folder&gt; = &quot;cd $1{Enter}&quot;;</tt></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Last and perhaps most useful is the following global command to move quickly 
  to a specific folder in a &quot;File Open&quot; dialog box:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#ffffcc">
  <tbody>
    <tr> 
      <td><p><i><font color="#993366"><tt>From file _vocola.vcl:</tt></font></i></p>
        <tt> include folders.vch;<br>
        <br>
        Open | New | Save | File | Attachment | Browse | Directory:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Folder &lt;folder&gt; = $1\{Enter};<br>
</tt></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>This global contextual command is active when the window title of any application 
  contains one of the words shown. For example, when saving an attachment in Microsoft 
  Outlook the window title is &quot;Save Attachment&quot;, so saying &quot;Folder 
  Temp&quot; switches the dialog's current folder to &quot;C:\Temp&quot;.</p>
<h3>Include using a variable filename</h3>
<p>The &quot;include&quot; statement's filename can be varied using references 
  to environment variables. For example, you might have a different set of interesting 
  folders at home than at work, and so want to include a different file depending 
  on which machine you are currently using. Since the environment variable &quot;COMPUTERNAME&quot; 
  contains the name of your machine, you could say:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><tt>include folders_$COMPUTERNAME.vch;</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your work machine were called &quot;Venus&quot; and your home machine were 
  called &quot;family&quot;, you would define your list of interesting folders 
  in two separate files, &quot;folders_Venus.vch&quot; and &quot;folders_family.vch&quot;.</p>

<p>You can configure Vocola to allow speaking several commands in a row without 
  pausing. For example, assume your commands allow you to say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr> 
        <td>&quot;3 Words Right&quot;</td>
        <td><tt>&nbsp;</tt></td>
        <td>to move the cursor 3 words to the right,</td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <td>&quot;2 Right&quot;</td>
        <td><br></td>
        <td>to move the cursor 2 characters to the right, and</td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="Top"> 
        <td>&quot;Kill Char&quot;</td>
        <td><br></td>
        <td>to delete 1 character.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wanted to speak these three commands in succession you would normally 
  have to pause between commands, saying</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;3 Words Right&quot; (pause) &quot;2 Right&quot; (pause) &quot;Kill 
    Char&quot;.</p></blockquote>
  With Vocola you don't need to pause, so you can say
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;3 Words Right 2 Right Kill Char&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you get used to speaking command sequences, text editing by voice becomes 
  faster and less frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: A bug introduced in Dragon NaturallySpeaking 7.0 
  and worsened in 8.0 can cause unacceptable performance if command sequences 
  are enabled. With 7.0 switching to or from an application becomes slow if a 
  large number of commands are defined for the application. With 8.0 users have 
  reported that command recognition is very slow even when only a few commands 
  are defined.</p>
<p>Because of these NaturallySpeaking bugs (which ScanSoft has essentially refused 
  to fix), Vocola command sequences are disabled by default and not recommended 
  with version 8.0. Personally I find them so productive that I've stayed with 
  NaturallySpeaking 6.0.</p>
<h3><a name="Enable"></a>How to Enable and Disable Command Sequences</h3>
<p>To enable command sequences (in Vocola 2.5 or later), open the file:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <tt>NatLink\Vocola\Exec\vocola.ini</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and modify it to contain the line:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>Use Command Sequences=1</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then say &quot;Load All Commands&quot;. </p>
<p>To disable command sequences, proceed as above but with the line:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>Use Command Sequences=0</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>Note that only commands defined in the same file can be spoken in sequence. 
  For me this causes occasional mistakes but is not a major limitation. And using 
  <a href="IncludeStatements.html">include files</a> can help. For example, if 
  you find you want to sequence some of your global commands with commands local 
  to Microsoft Word, you could put the global commands in a separate .vch file 
  and include that file in both word.vcl and _vocola.vcl.</p>
<p>You might think command sequences would lead to mistakes when an unexpected 
  combination of commands is recognized, but in practice I have not found this 
  to be the case. It's a good idea to avoid single-word commands, but that's a 
  good idea anyway.</p>

  </ul>
  <li> Associate the <tt>.vcl</tt> file extension (used for Vocola command files) 
    with your favorite text editor. (This allows you to open your Vocola files 
    using built-in voice commands.) An easy way to set up this association is 
    to right-click on any <tt>.vcl</tt> file (such as <tt>Vocola\Samples\notepad.vcl</tt>), 
    select "Open", and pick your favorite text editor (for example, Notepad). 
    <br>
    <br>Emacs users should install <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq3.html#assoc"> 
    gnuserv</a> and associate the <tt>.vcl</tt> file extension with gnuclientw.exe. 
    (Make sure the directory containing <tt>gnuclientw.exe</tt> is included in

    <li>Say "Test Simple Command". The phrase "It works!" should appear.</li>
    <li>Say "Edit Voice Commands". <tt>Vocola\Commands\notepad.vcl</tt> should 
      be opened using the editor you picked in step 4.</li>
    <li>Change the "Test Simple Command" command to type "It really works!"</li>
    <li> Save the file, say "Switch to Notepad", and say "Test Simple Command".&nbsp;"It

If you have created voice commands using the Dragon macro language you may want 
to jumpstart your repertoire of Vocola commands using the utility <tt>dvc2vcl.exe</tt>, 
found in the folder <tt>Vocola\Exec</tt>. <i><b> Note: this utility is&nbsp; provided 
"as is". You are welcome to make improvements.</b></i><br>
<br>

This utility converts many commands correctly, handling keystroke sequences,
function calls, word arguments, lists, and lists with substitution. Most
of my 200+ macros converted fine, with some manual cleanup required for the
rest. If the utility cannot handle a particular command construct it is replaced
with "[]" and the resulting command is commented out.<br>
<br>

The utility takes two arguments -- an input folder containing Dragon voice
command files (*.dvc), and an output folder to contain Vocola files (*.vcl).
For example, the script might be invoked as follows (assuming Vocola is installed
in C:\NatLink\Vocola and NatSpeak is installed in C:\NatSpeak):<br>
<br>
<tt>cd C:\NatLink\Vocola<br>
Exec\dvc2vcl C:\NatSpeak\Users\Rick\current Commands<br>
</tt><br>

Each <tt>.dvc</tt> file in the input folder <tt>C:\NatSpeak\Users\Rick\current</tt>
 is converted to one or more <tt>.vcl</tt> files, which are written to the
output folder <tt>C:\NatLink\Vocola\Commands</tt>. Global commands are written
to the file <tt>_vocola.vcl</tt>, and application-specific commands for an
application named <tt>foo.exe</tt> are written to <tt>foo.vcl</tt>. <br>
<br>

If you have added commands to the default Dragon command file <tt>global.dvc</tt>, you may want to make a copy of the file and delete the Dragon-supplied
commands so that you only convert your own commands. There's no particular
value in converting the Dragon-supplied commands to Vocola.<br>

Writing Vocola commands is straightforward with a little practice. This page summarizes 
some potential problems, and how to solve them. 
<h3> My command doesn't work</h3>

 You've written a Vocola command but nothing happens when you speak the command. 
Here are some possible causes: 
<ol>
  <li> You didn't save the .vcl file.</li>
  <br>&nbsp; 
  <li> Your command had a syntax error.</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Vocola reports errors in the NatLink output window, a small window titled 
      &quot;Messages from Python Macros&quot;.</li>
    <li>Read the error message, correct the problem, save the file, close the 
      NatLink window, and try your command again.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    &nbsp; 
  </ul>
  <li> You're speaking the command in a different context than you defined it 
    for.</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Make sure you put the command in the .vcl file for the application you're 
      running.</li>
    <li> If your command appears within a <a href="ContextualCommands.html"> context 
      statement</a>, make sure the context string matches the title of the current 
      window.</li>
    <br>
    &nbsp; 
  </ul>
  <li> You changed an include file (.vch) and didn't run the Vocola translator 
    by saying "Load Voice Commands".
  <br>&nbsp; 
  </li>
  <li> NatLink didn't load the translated Python file. 
    <ul>
      <li> Look in the NatLink\MacroSystem directory. There should be both a .py 
        file and a .pyc with the same name as your .vcl file.</li>
      <li> If the .pyc file is <i>older</i> than the .py file, and you really 
        have talked at the correct application, then NatLink has not noticed the 
        .py file. There are two possible reasons:</li>
      <ul>
        <li> You have created a new global command file (one beginning with underscore, 
          &quot;_&quot;). NatLink does not notice these.</li>
        <li> NatLink or NatSpeak is in a bad state.</li>
      </ul>
      <li> In either case, you need to exit and restart NatSpeak.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3> My command doesn't work right</h3>

 Your command gets executed, but doesn't work correctly. Here are some possible 
causes: 

<ol>
<li> Another command is being executed instead.</li><ul>
    <li> You may have defined a command with the same words using another voice 
      command language. It's a good idea to delete these.</li>
    <li> You may have defined a global command and an application-specific command 
      with the same words. Usually the application-specific command will be recognized, 
      but occasionally the global command is recognized instead. Usually if you 
      repeat the command the application-specific version will be recognized.<br>
    </li></ul>
  <br>
  <li> You need to use quotation marks in your Vocola command. Quotation mark 
    delimiters are usually optional in Vocola, but are required in some cases:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> when whitespace is significant, e.g. "<tt>{Left 2}</tt>"</li>
    <li>when keystrokes to enter contain <a href="QuotesAndWhitespace.html#SpecialChars">special 
      characters</a></li>
  </ul>
</ol>

I will do my best to fix Vocola problems, but as usual with free
software supported in spare time I make no guarantees. Before e-mailing,
please consult the <a href="LanguageTutorial.html">Language Tutorial</a>, the
section on <a href="Troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a>, and the list
of known bugs below. I wrote this documentation with you in mind, so please
read it and try to solve your problem before contacting me.

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>

The following problems are known to exist with Vocola 2.5: 
<ul>
  <li>A bug introduced in Dragon NaturallySpeaking 7.0 and worsened in 8.0 can 
    cause unacceptable performance if <a href="CommandSequences.html">command 
    sequences</a> are enabled. ScanSoft has thus far refused to address the problem, 
    so if you're experiencing a slowdown your options are to <a href="CommandSequences.html#enable">disable 
    command sequences</a> or use an earlier NatSpeak version such as 6.0.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My RSI Story</h2>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"><html><head>
  <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"><title>My RSI Story</title></head><body>
<p>In March 1998 I worked an entire weekend to meet a major deadline with important 
  revenue consequences for my employer. By Sunday night my wrists and hands were 
  tingling and sensitive, and the next day I had significant wrist pain. In previous 
  years I had had minor symptoms, but they had always gone away.<br>
  <br>
  I knew to treat my injury seriously since I have friends with debilitating RSI 
  problems. But, I was starting at square zero in terms of knowledge and treatment, 
  and still in the middle of a high-pressure work situation. As I began to realize 
  my injury was serious I started searching for solutions. Everyone I talked to 
  had different ideas, and every idea seemed to involve 30-90 minutes a day of 
  work on my part. I could handle the regimen of one or two of these, but in the 
  absence of real progress it was hard to have confidence. In the subsequent months 
  I tried doctors, occupational therapy, anti-inflammatories, massage, a new chair, 
  acupuncture, rolfing, special keyboards, physical therapy, drinking lots of 
  water, chiropractic, vitamins, myotherapy, and glucosamine sulfate. Nothing 
  seemed to make a reliable difference.<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile my company was supportive and willing to provide what I asked. But 
  while it was easy to ask for new equipment and small schedule accommodations, 
  I couldn't bring myself to ask for major time commitments from other people 
  or major project slippage. I adjusted all my habits to require as little typing 
  is possible, but continued to type when necessary (occasionally a considerable 
  amount).<br>
  <br>
  Unfortunately it took a year of this before I began using voice recognition 
  and started truly resting my hands. I can't know for sure, but I believe that 
  had I started using voice recognition right away I would have recovered. During 
  several periods I've made significant recovery, but despite vigilance in most 
  every activity I have always slipped up. Once it was snow shoveling, once un-careful 
  fiddling, and once not-wimpy-enough weightlifting in a strengthening program. 
  Of all the things I have tried, the only ones that have reliably helped are 
  avoiding irritating activities and voice recognition. Of some help have been 
  stretching, posture improvement, myotherapy, and massage. </p>
<p> Since resting my hands seemed so important I tried for hands-free computer 
  use as much as possible. The Dragon Macro Language made this possible but was 
  excruciatingly cumbersome, so I was very excited when Joel Gould released NatLink. 
  Shortly thereafter (at NEFFA) Patricia Hawkins and I were comparing notes about 
  NatLink. Her comment "yeah, but you still have to change two places" got me 
  thinking about Vocola. <br>
  <br>
  Designing, implementing, and using Vocola has been a rewarding bright spot among 
  otherwise unsuccessful attempts at recovery. And thankfully, with Dragon NaturallySpeaking, 
  NatLink, and Vocola I've continued to be effective at my job.<br>
  <br>
  The main lesson I take away is to stand up for my own needs when they conflict 
  with the needs and desires of others. That Monday deadline seemed very important 
  at the time, but everybody would have survived just fine if I had delivered 
  a week later. The customer was adamant about the deadline, but as it happens 
  they ultimately canceled the project! And even after my initial injury, if I 
  had been brave enough during the first year to ask for difficult adjustments 
  at work I might have been able to recover quickly.</p>
<p>One doctor I saw said "With constant vigilance you can get a little better 
  every year" and at this writing (December 2004) things are looking up somewhat, 
  I'm starting to type a little and play some careful fiddle.<br>
