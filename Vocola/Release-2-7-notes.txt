New in 2.7:

! Code generation for actions completely rewritten

! Runtime errors are now caught and displayed in a more user-friendly
  manner.  (No incomprehensible Python stack traces anymore.)

! New built-in EvalTemplate, which provides a more powerful version of Eval.

* Eval is now implemented via transformation to EvalTemplate.

! User functions are now implemented by unrolling; this allows passing
  instructions like SendDragonKeys(-), not just string-valued
  expressions, to user functions.

! How underscores in keystroke strings (e.g., "hello{enter_2}") are
  handled has changed:

  Now underscores are converted only just before a keystroke sending
  procedure like SendDragonKeys is called; moreover, only underscores
  that occur in the right place in a keystroke are converted.  E.g.,
  {__2} types __, not "  ".

  This is much more consistent than the previous behavior, which could
  convert underscores not part of a keystroke (e.g., {a}_{b} used to
  produce "a b", as well as failed to convert underscores that were part
  of a keystroke if the entire keystroke was not contained in a single
  string action (e.g., {left_ F(x)} didn't work before).

* Fixed a bug making ShiftKey not work.

* Fixed a bug where combining <_anything> and an optional word caused
  only the first word of the <_anything> to be returned.

* New samples file, _Dragon_help.vcl, showing how to use the HTMLHelp
  call to display help for Vocola calls using Dragon NaturallySpeaking
  professional/legal/medical.

* Fixed a bug where if the first error in a Vocola file was an undefined
  variable reference, then the (base) file name containing the error(s)
  was not displayed.
