New in 2.6.3:

! Commands are recognized faster because the Vocola compiler is run
  during recognition only if at least one file in a Vocola command
  folder has been changed/added.

* Now falls back on using Notepad if no editor has been associated with
  .vcl files.

* Now using os.startfile(-) instead of Simpscrp to open command files.


New in 2.6.2:

! New built-in Unimacro(-) added.

* Documentation removed in favor of the web site.


New in 2.6.1:

* Fixed a bug where using an in-line list twice in the same command
  caused problems when it contained quotation marks.

* Fixed samples/_vocola.vcl so dragging windows works correctly.  (Older
  version is no longer compatible with Dragon function argument
  handling: +1 is no longer treated as an integer.)

* fixed end of line conventions in samples/{msdev.vcl,URLs.vch,visio32.vcl,
  dreamweaver.vcl,keys.vch,mstsc.vcl,natspeak.vcl,nlnotes.vcl,notepad.vcl,
  winword.vcl}.

! new version of simpscrp.pyd compiled for Python 2.5

* switched VocolaUtils.py to using exception classes instead of strings.


New in 2.6:

* backed out change to handling of Eval arguments made in 2.5.8 because
  it broke Eval.  Arguments are treated as type integer iff they have
  the *standard* form of an integer.  This prevents loss of information
  when an argument needs to be treated as a string even if it has the
  form of an integer (done via str($1)).  This breaks backward
  compatibility with commands that relied on "+2" being treated as an
  integer.  Such commands should either use "2" or int($1) to force
  treatment as an integer.

* changed example in DefiningFunctions.html using "+10" as an "integer"
  to use "10" instead to avoid the above problem.

* made the Eval description clearer about how Eval guesses variable types
  and how to force a type when Eval guesses wrong.

* VocolaVersions.html now warns of the change to Eval's behavior.


New in 2.5.9:

* Added Scott's vcledit.vcl as a sample Vocola command file.

* Updated wish list


New in 2.5.8:

* Arguments passed to user functions are always passed as strings rather
  than sometime strings and sometimes integers.

* References/function arguments passed to Eval are treated as type
  integer iff they contain a string that is the representation of an
  integer (i.e., an optional plus or minus sign followed by one or more
  digits).

* Added documentation for WaitForWindow and HTMLHelp.

* Two separate versions of _vocola_main.py are no longer required, one
  for the installer and one for the non-installer cases.


New in 2.5.7:

* when Dragon rejects a Dragon function because of bad syntax, the
  resulting error message now includes the exact text that produced the
  syntax error.

* the number of arguments passed to Dragon functions that take a varying
  number of arguments is now checked (e.g., not too few or too many).

* WakeUp and MenuCancel now correctly take no arguments.

! The Dragon WaitForWindow and HTMLHelp commands are now supported.

* Arguments passed to Dragon functions are now coerced to the
  appropriate type.  (Previously, they were treated as integer iff they
  had the form of canonical numbers; this caused problems when a numeric
  string was passed to a function expecting a string and when a
  non-canonical number (e.g., "+1") was passed to a function expecting
  an integer.)  Failed coercions produce Vocola runtime errors.


New in 2.5.6:

* variable names (e.g., <foo>) can once again start with leading digits.

* As a baby step towards supporting multiple languages/non-ASCII, Vocola
  now assumes its input is encoded using Latin-1.  

* Vocola releases starting with this one can now be installed over
  previous releases installed via the installer.

* Added [search] Google for <_anything> macro to _vocola.vcl sample
  file.

* Replaced call to quotewords with a handwritten replacement to avoid
  tickling a bug in the Perl regular expression engine.



New in 2.5.5:

* Fixed a bug that caused pointless error messages (BadWindow) to be
  produced when windows disappear in the middle of an utterance.

* _vocola_main.py has been generalized to be able to handle any number
  of command folders.

* command files with the same name in different command folders no
  longer cause unpredictable behavior with only one's commands active at
  a time: now both of their commands will be active at the same time.

* _vocola_main.py now releases its callback when unloaded.

* A bug that sometimes caused not all commands to be properly loaded at
  startup has been fixed thanks to a patch by Matthew Vermilion.

! New command files are always compiled and loaded (if compilation was
  successful) at the start of the next utterance.  (Previously, toggling
  the microphone or issuing an explicit Load ... Commands command was
  sometimes necessary to load new files.)

* All command files for the current application / global context
  including machine specific files are now loaded by the Load
  (Global) [Voice] Commands.  (Previously, only the canonical file
  (e.g., explorer.vcl for Windows Explorer) was loaded.)

* Command file's whose filenames contain hyphens before an @ no longer
  work with older versions of NatLink as a side effect of a change
  required to let Vocola work with applications whose name contains a
  hyphen (requires a newer version of NatLink).

* Through careful name mangling it now is possible to determine the
  source file name corresponding to each vocola output filename.

* Vocola now removes old compiled commands on startup when no user
  command folder is present.  (Previously, this was mistakenly only done
  when a user command folder was present.)

* A warning about using large number ranges was added to the documentation.

* Fixed bug with ntvdm.vcl example command "Folder <folder>" where it
  failed to handle folder names containing spaces properly.



New in 2.5.4:

* A bug that caused user functions and Dragon procedures to crash when
  called with either a single repeat expression or menu body reference
  as an argument has been fixed.

* A bug that incorrectly caused an error to be reported when expressions
  like Repeat(0, foo) that produce no effects (not even "") were passed
  to user functions has been fixed.

* The Eval function now works correctly on any action instead of just word
  and reference actions.

* Bugs that caused eval to crash when passed an action producing other
  than a single effect, the result of a Dragon call, or a word
  containing a single quotation have been fixed.

* The description of Eval has been modified to describe what it actually
  does and to provide more useful information for using it.

! A small library of string functions implemented via Eval has been
  provided (samples/string.vch).

* A misleading error message (Dragon functions may not be nested) was
  changed to the more informative "conversion error: unable to convert
  value <v> to a string due to the presence of a Dragon call" message,
  where <v> is the problematic value in question.



New in 2.5.3:

* A bug that caused Vocola to produce ill-formed Python code when given
  a list containing an empty alternative (no actions) has been fixed.

* Strings containing newlines or carriage returns can now be passed to
  Dragon functions thanks to a workaround provided by Quintijn Hoogenboom.

* The rule for escaping dollar signs in actions has changed slightly to:
    \$ -> <non special $>
  it was:
    \$[a-zA-Z_] -> <non special $><same last char>
  That is, previously "\$1 \$% $2" interpolated to "$1 \$% <value of $2>";
  now it interpolates to "$1 $% <value of $2>".
  
  The new rule should be both easier to remember (write \$ when you wish
  a literal $) and easier to automatically produce code using.

* The same rule now applies to include statements (previously, no
  unescaping was done).  The code for include statements was changed so
  that all variables are simultaneously substituted only once for
  consistency (previously, substitution was iterated allowing the values
  of variables to refer to still other variables).

* A bug that caused backslashes to be doubled in include filenames has
  been fixed.

* The set of well-formed references in include statements is now the
  same as that in actions for consistency.  In particular, $12abc is now
  <value of $12>abc instead of <value of $123abc>.

* A bug that caused context alternatives containing quotes or newlines
  to produce illegal python code has been fixed.

! From the wish list: Context statement ":" now clears any existing context.  


New in 2.5.2:

* A bug with passing strings that are noncanonical representations of
  numbers (e.g., "0010" or "-012") to user or Dragon functions has been
  fixed.  (Previously, attempting to pass "0010" instead passed "8" (the
  value of 10 in octal).)

* The documentation now states more clearly that global command files
  need only start with an underscore, rather than "_vocola".


* The source code now indicates what strings qualify as names and
  function names.

* Names (of lists, functions, and formals) may now start with underscores.

* Illegal list names are now complained about.

* A bug that caused the parser to barf on formals lists with leading or
  trailing whitespace has been fixed.

* A warning was added to the documentation about a NatLink bug that
  causes Vocola filenames with non-word characters to be ignored.

* Fixed a bug that prevented the Edit Machine commands from bringing up
  an editor when the Vocola user directory pathname contained spaces.

* Added a note to the documentation letting users know that the messages
  from the Python macros window can be reset by closing it, and that its
  contents can be copied to a larger window for easier viewing.

* The documentation now indicates that unlike variables, functions must
  be declared before being used.



New in 2.5.1 versus 2.5:

* multiple line quotations are now banned.  (They didn't really work
  before.)  Error handling/reporting for unterminated
  quotations/quotations spanning multiple lines is now much better.

! Quotation marks of kind X may now be quoted within X-quotations by
  doubling them:
     " red "" and '' blue " == ' red " and '''' blue '


* A bug that prevented passing strings containing quotations, newlines,
  or carriage returns to user functions has been fixed.

* A bug that prevented passing strings containing quotations to Dragon
  functions (e.g., ShellExecute) has been fixed.

* Because a NatLink/DNS bug prevents passing strings containing newlines
  or carriage returns to Dragon functions, attempting to do this now
  produces a clear Vocola error rather than an obscure crash.


* Bare words are now correctly broken at quotation marks; e.g.,
  previously fred"foo" was considered one word containing two quotation
  marks rather than equivalent to Fred "foo".

* A bug that caused comments containing quotation marks to produce
  syntax errors has been fixed.

* The documentation now correctly states that a keystroke sequence
  containing a : at the end must be quoted.

* The source code now correctly indicates what tokens qualify as words
  and bare words.
