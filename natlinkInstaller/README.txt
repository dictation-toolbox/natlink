We are well underway to make a new stable release for Dragon 12 and NatLink too. (July 26, 2013)

-This includes a new stable Vocola release which is complete implemented in python

-NatLink can be used with python 2.6 and python 2.7.

-Note that with Dragon 12, you should NOT use the speech model BestMatch V, which is used by default on most computers when create a new User Profile.

-Python 2.5 still can be used, but only for Dragon <= 11.

Consider to make a small donation to the 3 people who do most work for this development:
-Rudiger Wilke, working on the heart of the program, the NatLink core
-Mark Lillibridge, maintaining and improving Vocola 2
-Quintijn Hoogenboom, working at Unimacro and the installer stuff
