Release notes for NatLink/Vocola/Unimacro combined installer 3.7beta:

New in Vocola version 2.6.3:

* Unimacro actions can now be called from Vocola commands if Unimacro
  has been installed.

* Commands are recognized faster because the Vocola compiler is run
  during recognition only if at least one file in a Vocola command
  folder has been changed/added.

* Python 2.5 is now supported.


New in the combined NatLink/Vocola/Unimacro installer:

* automatic loading of changed Vocola command files is working properly
  again (no extra steps like toggling the microphone required)

* Vocola command files are automatically associated with the Notepad editor.

* The command line configuration program has clearer built-in instructions.


New in Unimacro:

* Mostly small adaptations to make Unimacro/Vocola integration work.

* Unimacro website revised in a lot of spots.

* The actions.ini file is not overwritten anymore in this release.
  Check for changes with the version in the sample_ini directory of
  unimacro, if you encounter problems.
