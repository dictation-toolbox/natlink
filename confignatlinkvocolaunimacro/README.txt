this is a wxPython application, which was set up with wxDesigner.

The file configurenatlink.wdr is the project file for this.  

But with configurenatlink.py you can run this one, 
only needing (for the GUI part): configurenatlink_wdr.py

Still very preliminary, first get the natlinkconfigfunctions.py at work.
