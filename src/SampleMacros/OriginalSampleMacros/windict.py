#
# This is a sample Python program which demonstrates how to use the
# Natlink dictation object in a Python program.  The user interface for
# this programn is based on the PythonWin (win32) extensions.
#
# The basic idea is as follows.
#
# Dragon NaturallySpeaking handles dictation by having a dictation object
# which contains a copy oft he user document.  In this way, NatSpeak knows
# what text is on the screen so it can get the spacing write.  It also
# knows the text on the screen for the Select and Correct commands.
#
# When writing an application which supports dictation (and voice editing),
# the application must keep the contents of the NatSpeak dictation object in
# sync with the text on the screen.
#
# In this sample application, we illustrate doing this for a rich edit
# control.  There will be a rich edit contorl on the screen and we keep its
# contents synchronized with a NatSpeak dictation object.  Thus, our simple
# edit control will allow our window to behave like NatSpeak's own editor
# window (althoug hnot every feature is exposed).
#
# For correctness, you only have to intercept the "begin" callback which
# happens just before recognition starts.  At that point you have to make
# sure that the internal dictation object has a complete copy of the state
# of the edit control -- text, selection and visible range.  Then when
# recognition occurs, the dictation object will return information about
# what change happened --- text deleted, text added and selection moved.
#
# To optimize for better performance and to prevent the lose of recorded
# speech, it helps if the code doe snot wait until the tsart of recognition,
# but instead updates the dictation object after every change of the edit
# control.
#
# The best implementation only tells the dictation object aboiut the change
# (for example a character was typed), but in this code I update the
# dictation object with the entire contents of the edit control on every
# keystroke.
