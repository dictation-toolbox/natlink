# trainuser.py
#   This is a sample python script which will create a new trained user
#   from a series of recorded sessions.
#

########################################################################
#
# This script takes the following things as input:
#
# (1) A set of NWV files which contain recordings made by speaking
#   to Dragon NaturallySpeaking.
#
#   An NWV file is a industry standard NIST wave file.  Such files can be
#   created by running the SaveWave program which comes with Dragon
#   NaturallySpeaking then using NatSpeak normally.
#
# (2) A corresponding set of LST files which contain the transcripts
#   for the recordings in the NWV files.  There should be one LST file
#   for every NWV file (with the same filename).  The LST file must have
#   one line for every separate utterance in the NWV file.  That line
#   should contain the transcript of the utterance.
#
#   When you run SaveWave, it create a LST file which contains the recognized
#   transacript.  If there have been recognition errors this transacript
#   will be wrong and need to be corrected before the LST file is used
#   for training.
#
#   To exclude an utterance from training (for example, because it was
#   garbled), you should make the corresponding line in the LST file blank.
#
#   The spelling of words in the transcripts in the LST file need to be
#   modified in some cases.  Specifically, a space character is used to
#   delimit words so if there are any spaces inside of words (like the
#   word "New York"), those spaces need to be converted into underscores.
#
#   For completeness, underscores are converted into the two character
#   sequence tilde-underscore (~_) and tilde characters are converted into
#   the two character sequence tilde-tilde (~~).  Finally, some older files
#   use the two character sequence tilde-right parenthesisinstead of a single
#   right parenthesis.  This is supported but not required.
#
# (3) The name of a user to create.
#
# (4) The name of the base models to use to create the user.  The base
#   models can be found in the registry under the key:
#
#       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Dragon Systems\NaturallySpeaking\
#       Professional 3.0\System\Base Models
#
#   For the Preferred version, the key contains the string "Preferred 3.0"
#   instead of "Professional 3.0".  International version will also have
#   a different edition name.
#
#   For Professional 3.02 and 3.52 versions, the following base models
#   are available:
#       BestMatch Model
#       Standard Model
#
# (5) The name of the base topic to use to create the user.  The base
#   topics can also be found in the registry in the same place except for
#   the name of the last key:
#
#       ...\System\Base Topics
#
#   For Professional 3.02 and 3.52 versions, the following base models
#   are available:
#
#       General English - BestMatch
#       General English - BestMatch 64k+
#       General English - Standard
