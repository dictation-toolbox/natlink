# _mouse.py
#   Sample macro file which implements mouse and keyboard movement modes
#   similar to DragonDictate for Windows

# April 1, 2000
#   Updates from Jonathan Epstein
#   - cancel arrow movement when the active window changes
#   - add support for tray icon during arrow movement
#
# April 2022, adapting a little for python3
