# This sample macro file was created for my talk to the Boston Voice Users
# group on November 9, 1999.  It is explained in my PowerPoint slides.
#
# _sample5.py
#
# This sample file d\xe9monstrates how to use the clipboard to communicate
# between your application and Python code.  To use this macro, make sure
# that NatSpeak is active and that there is text in the window.  Position
# the caret inside a word on the screen and say "d\xe9mo sample five".  This
# code will then reverse the letters in the word containing the caret.
#
# You can say "d\xe9mo sample five 3 words" and this code will reverse three
# words ending with the word which contains the caret.
#
# Notice that we send keystrokes to select the words in NatSpeak.  Then we
# send the keystroke ctrl+c to copy the selected word to the clipboard.  The
# function natlink.getClipboard() give this code access to the clipboard. We
# reverse the text and send it back to the application (by typing it).
#
# Put in MacroSystem folder and toggle the microphone.
# Write "d\xe9mo" to force command recognition.
