# This sample macro file was created for my talk to the Boston Voice Users
# group on November 9, 1999.  It is explained in my PowerPoint slides.
#
# _sample2.py
#
# This is a sample macro file with a two commands.  When NatSpeak has the
# focus, say "d\xe9mo sample two".  It should recognize the command and type:
#   Say "d\xe9mo sample two color     (the word color will be in italics)
#
# Say "d\xe9mo sample two red" and it would recognize the command and type:
#   The color is red               (it types the name of the color you say)
#
# This file d\xe9monstrates having two commands in one grammar.  Natlink knows
# which rule was recognized and calls the appropiate handling function
# (gotResults_xxx).  This file also d\xe9monstrates using the actual words
# recognized to control the results (we type the name of the spoken color).
# Put in MacroSystem folder and toggle the microphone.
# Write "d\xe9mo" to force command recognition.
