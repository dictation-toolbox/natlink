#
# This sample macro file was created for my talk to the Boston Voice Users
# group on November 9, 1999.  It is explained in my PowerPoint slides.
#
# _sample1.py
#
# This is a sample macro file with a single command.  When NatSpeak has the
# focus, say "demo sample one".  It should recognize the command and type:
#   Heard macro "sample one".
#
# This file represents the simplest possible example of a Natlink macro.
#
# See also the variant _first_sample_docstring.py in the folder DisabledGrammars of Unimacro
# Put in MacroSystem folder and toggle the microphone.
# Write "d\xe9mo" to force command recognition.
#
