# This is a sample grammar file.  I have implemented some basic formatting
# for Microsoft WordPad (main window).
#
# This file is loaded automatically if, and only if, a module called
# "wordpad" is active when the microphone is turned on or an utterance begins.
# The Python file must have the same name as the module (except the Python
# filename must be in lowercase).
#

# The following file gets us access to the basic NatSpeak functions like
# the ability to send keystrokes to an application.

import natlink

# The following file contains the GrammarBase infrastructure and some utility
# functions like convertResults and matchWindow.

    # there will only be one word from "verb" during each recognition.

    # Our op level rules are "setFont" and "verbObj".  We can not rely on
    # the function gotResults_verbObj being called, however, because there
    # are no words in the rule "verbObj".  Fortunately, when the top-level
    # rule "verbObj" is recognized, the rule "verb" will also be recognized.
    #
    # When we get a word from "verb" we look that word up in a Python
    # dictionary and execute the code fragment which matches that word.
    # In this example, the code fragment sets a local variable to a string
    # to send to the target application.  We then send that string to the

    # The base class calls this function when one or more words in the

    # "setFont" are not interesting.  For example, if the user says
    # "set font Arial bold", then gotResults_setFont will be passed
    # the array ['set','font'] in the words parameter.
    #
    # However, each results callback also gets an array which contains
    # the full results.  For the previous example, the parameter fullResults
    # will contain the following complex array:
    #   [ ['set','setFont'], ['font','setFont'], ['Arial','fontFace'],
    #     ['bold','fontStyle'] ]
    #
    # Warning: gotResults_setFont could be called twice if there are multiple
    # disjoint sequences of words in the results from the "setFont" rule.
    # For example, if the user says "set font size 16 points", the function
    # gotResults_setFont will be called twice, once with the words parameter
    # set to ['set','font','size'] and once with the words parameter set to
    # ['points'].  To avoid doing the action twice, we set a flag at the start
    # of recognition (self.sawResults).
    #
    # To handle handle recognitions from "setFont", we use the fullResults.
    # However, the format of "fullResults" is not convient for our use.
    # Therefore, we use the function "convertResults" to convert fullResults
    # into a dictionary.  For the example above, this produces:
    #   { 'setFont':['set,'font'], 'fontFace':['Arial'], 'fontStyle':['bold'] }
    #
    # Now we can individually perform an action based on the fontFace, 
    # fontSize and fontStyle if found.
