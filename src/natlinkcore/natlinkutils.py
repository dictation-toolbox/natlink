  This file contains utility classes and functions for grammar files.

  Documentation

  This file contains three base classes and some useful constants and
    utility functions:

  GrammarBase - base class for all command and control grammars.
      See documentation below just before the class definition.

  DictGramBase - base class for all pure dictation grammars.
      See documentation below just before the class definition.

  SelectGramBase - base class for all selection grammars.
      See documentation below just before the class definition.

  buttonClick( btnName='left',count=1 )
      This function simulates a button click or button double click.  Pass
      in the button name ('left','right' or 'middle') and the count (1 or
      2)

  matchWindow( moduleInfo, modName, wndText )
      A utility function which determines whether moduleInfo matches a
      specified module name and window title.  Returns window handle on
      match and None on mismatch. Note that moduleInfo may be ("","",0)
      which we should handle cleanly.

  playString(string, hooks=None)
      Send keystrokes to the foreground window.
      
      Due to problems with duplicating or dropping the first character of a string
      when sending to the foreground window, this function is obsolete, and you should
      use sendkeys from dragonfly via dtactions

#       This function will takes a textual representation of a grammar,
#       either as a single string or as a list of strings and load that
#       grammar into Dragon NaturallySpeaking.
#
#       allResults=1 will make it so this grammar see every recognition
#           result even if it is for another grammar,
#       hypothesis=1 means that the gotHypothesis callback will be made.
#           Otherwise, that callback is not made to avoid too much overhead.
#
#   unload()
#       Unload reset the state of the grammar.  Any SAPI objects will be
#       freed and all callbacks will be terminated.
#
# You need to activate rules before they will be recognized.  You activate
# rules by name.  Any rule which is "exported" in the grammar can be
# activated.  This base class offers a number of was to activate rules
# depending on what is convient.
#
#   activate( ruleName, window=0, exclusive=None, noError=0 )
#       Activate a single rule by name.
#
#       noError=1 will suppress the error message when you try to activate
#           a rule which is already active
#       window=N will activate this rule conditionally when the window
#           whose window handle is X is the foreground window.  This is
#           the normal case.  Use window=0 to activate a global rule.
#       exclusive=1 will make this grammar exclusive which means that no
#           other grammars will be included in recognition when this
#           grammar is active unless they are also exclusive
#
#   activateSet( ruleNames, window=0, exclusive=None )
#       This is the most efficient way to activate rules, it takes a list of
#       rules and makes sure that all those rules and only those rules are
#       active.  Do not use this function to change the window handle if you
#       have already activates some rules with a different window handle.
#
#   activateAll( window=0, exclusive=None, exceptlist=None )
#       This will activate every exported rule.
#       can optionally add a list of rules NOT to activate (QH, 2010)
#
#   deactivate( ruleName, noError=0 )
#       Deactivates a single rule by name.
#         noError=1 will suppress the error message when you try to deactivate
#             a rule which is not active
#
#   deactivateAll():
#       This will deactivate every currently active rule.
#
#   setExclusive( exclusive ):
#       Set or reset the exclusive flag for this grammar (see comments under
#       activate method).
#
# Lists are part of SAPI.  They are list subrules except that they can be
# changed while the grammar is loaded.  Also, the list a word comes from is
# not available in recognition results, you only see the innermost rule name
# in recognition results.
#
#   emptyList( listName )
#       This will remove all words currently in a names list.
#
#   appendList( listName, words )
#       This will add one word (phrase) or a list of words (phrases) to a
#       named list.
#
#   setList( listName, words )
#       This function is an efficient way to set the contents of a list in    
#       one operation to a list of words or phrases.
#
# Derived classes should defined callback functions if they want recognition
# results.  The following callback functions can be defined:
#
#   gotBegin( moduleInfo )
#       called when speech is detected before recognition begins.  The
#       parameter is the same value returned by getCurrentModule.
#
#   gotResultsObject( recogType, resObj )
#       called when results are available (before any of the other results
#       callbacks).  The first parameter is one of 'self','other' or 'reject'
#       where the second two types are only possible if the allResults flag
#       was set on the load call.  The second parameter is the results object.
#
#   gotResultsInit( words, fullResults )
#       called when results are available for this grammar before any calls
#       to gotResults_XXX.  Parameters are a list of the recognized words
#       and a list of word,ruleName pairs.
#
#   gotResults_XXX( words, fullResults )
#       called when results are available.  The XXX refers to the rule name
#       in the grammar.  This function is called once for each sequential
#       series of words in the results which come from the same rule in the
#       grammar.  The first parameter is the sequential series of words and
#       the second parameter is a list of word,ruleName pairs.
#
#   gotResults( words, fullResults )
#       called when results are available for this grammar before any calls
#       to gotResults_XXX.  Parameters are a list of the recognized words
#       and the same value a list of word,ruleName pairs.
#
#   gotHypothesis( words)
#       only called when the hypothesis flag is set on load, this callback
#       contains the partial recognition hypothesis during recognition.
#       
# Here is an example of how the callbacks work.  Assume the following grammar:
#
#   <start> exported = this <ruleOne> is {list}
#   <ruleOne> = big <ruleTwo> object
#   <ruleTwo> = red | blue
#   
# And assume that {list} contains the words "good" and "bad".
#
# Now if "this big red object is good" is recognized, the following callbacks
# will be made (in the order indicated).  
#
# (Note: The second parameter to gotResults_XXX and gotResults is the same as
# the second parameter to gotResultsInit.  The example has been abbreviated
# to save space.)
#
#   gotBegin( ??? )
#   gotResultsObject( 'self', resObj )
#   gotResultsInit( 
#       ['this','big','red','object','is','good'],
#       [('this','start'),('big','ruleOne'),('red','RuleTwo'),
#           ('object','ruleOne'),('is','start'),('good','start')] )
#   gotResults_start( ['this'], ... )
#   gotResults_ruleOne( ['big'], ... )
#   gotResults_ruleTwo( ['red'], ... )
#   gotResults_ruleOne( ['object'], ... )
#   gotResults_start( ['is','good'], ... )
#   gotResults( ['this','big','red','object','is','good'], ... )

      rules and makes sure that all those rules and only those rules are
      active.  Do not use this function to change the window handle if you
      have already activates some rules with a different window handle.

  activateAll( window=0, exclusive=None, exceptlist=None )
      This will activate every exported rule.
      can optionally add a list of rules NOT to activate (QH, 2010)

  deactivate( ruleName, noError=0 )
      Deactivates a single rule by name.
        noError=1 will suppress the error message when you try to deactivate
            a rule which is not active

  deactivateAll():
      This will deactivate every currently active rule.

  setExclusive( exclusive ):
      Set or reset the exclusive flag for this grammar (see comments under
      activate method).

Lists are part of SAPI.  They are list subrules except that they can be
changed while the grammar is loaded.  Also, the list a word comes from is
not available in recognition results, you only see the innermost rule name
in recognition results.

  emptyList( listName )
      This will remove all words currently in a names list.

  appendList( listName, words )
      This will add one word (phrase) or a list of words (phrases) to a
      named list.

  setList( listName, words )
      This function is an efficient way to set the contents of a list in    
      one operation to a list of words or phrases.

Derived classes should defined callback functions if they want recognition
results.  The following callback functions can be defined:

  gotBegin( moduleInfo )
      called when speech is detected before recognition begins.  The
      parameter is the same value returned by getCurrentModule.

  gotResultsObject( recogType, resObj )
      called when results are available (before any of the other results
      callbacks).  The first parameter is one of 'self','other' or 'reject'
      where the second two types are only possible if the allResults flag
      was set on the load call.  The second parameter is the results object.

  gotResultsInit( words, fullResults )
      called when results are available for this grammar before any calls
      to gotResults_XXX.  Parameters are a list of the recognized words
      and a list of word,ruleName pairs.

  gotResults_XXX( words, fullResults )
      called when results are available.  The XXX refers to the rule name
      in the grammar.  This function is called once for each sequential
      series of words in the results which come from the same rule in the
      grammar.  The first parameter is the sequential series of words and
      the second parameter is a list of word,ruleName pairs.

  gotResults( words, fullResults )
      called when results are available for this grammar before any calls
      to gotResults_XXX.  Parameters are a list of the recognized words
      and the same value a list of word,ruleName pairs.

  gotHypothesis( words)
      only called when the hypothesis flag is set on load, this callback
      contains the partial recognition hypothesis during recognition.
      
Here is an example of how the callbacks work.  Assume the following grammar:

  <start> exported = this <ruleOne> is {list}
  <ruleOne> = big <ruleTwo> object
  <ruleTwo> = red | blue
  
And assume that {list} contains the words "good" and "bad".

Now if "this big red object is good" is recognized, the following callbacks
will be made (in the order indicated).  

(Note: The second parameter to gotResults_XXX and gotResults is the same as
the second parameter to gotResultsInit.  The example has been abbreviated
to save space.)

  gotBegin( ??? )
  gotResultsObject( 'self', resObj )
  gotResultsInit( 
      ['this','big','red','object','is','good'],
      [('this','start'),('big','ruleOne'),('red','RuleTwo'),
          ('object','ruleOne'),('is','start'),('good','start')] )
  gotResults_start( ['this'], ... )
  gotResults_ruleOne( ['big'], ... )
  gotResults_ruleTwo( ['red'], ... )
  gotResults_ruleOne( ['object'], ... )
  gotResults_start( ['is','good'], ... )
  gotResults( ['this','big','red','object','is','good'], ... )

    """This base class is similar to GrammarBase except that it is used for real
dictation grammars.  A real dictation grammar allows a client application
to get raw dictation results from the recognizer.  It is very similat to
creating a command and control grammar with the <dgndictation> rule except
that you have the added ability to set the dictation context (words to
consider as having been spoken juct before the current recognition).

Here are the functions which derived classes can call:

  load( allResults=0, hypothesis=0 )
      Creates the dictation grammar.  See GrammarBase class for definition
      of flags.

  unload()
      Unload reset the state of the grammar.  Any SAPI objects will be
      freed and all callbacks will be terminated.

You need to activate the grammar before it can be recognized.  Activation
of a dictation grammar is simplier than a command grammar because there
are no named rules.

  activate( window=0, exclusive=None )
      noError=1 will suppress the error message when you try to activate
          a rule which is already active
      window=N will activate this rule conditionally when the window
          whose window handle is X is the foreground window.  This is
          the normal case.  Use window=0 to activate a global rule.

  deactivate()
      Deactivates the grammar.

  setExclusive( exclusive ):
      Set or reset the exclusive flag for this grammar (see comments under
      activate method of GrammarBase).

Dictation gramars have a special method which allows you to indicate what
text should be considered to been recognized just before this dictation
result, and after this dictation result.

  setContext( beforeText='', afterText='' )
      Note current version of Dragon NaturallySpeaking ignore the
      afterText but the before text is critical to increasing recognition
      accuracy.

Derived classes should defined callback functions if they want recognition
results.  The following callback functions can be defined:

  gotBegin( moduleInfo )
      called when speech is detected before recognition begins.  The
      parameter is the same value returned by getCurrentModule.

  gotResultsObject( recogType, resObj )
      called when results are available (before any of the other results
      callbacks).  The first parameter is one of 'self','other' or 'reject'
      where the second two types are only possible if the allResults flag
      was set on the load call.  The second parameter is the results object.

  gotResults( words )
      called when results are available for this grammar.

      words = list of recognized words

  gotHypothesis( words )
      only called when the hypothesis flag is set on load, this callback
      contains the partial recognition hypothesis during recognition.

This base class is similar to GrammarBase except that it is used for A select XYZ grammar is a special grammar which
recognizes an utterance of the form "<verb> <text> [ through <text> ]"
where <verb> is specified and <text> is an arbitrary sequence of words in
a specified text buffer.

Here are the functions which derived classes can call:

make default select and through words "select" and "through" (lower case)

adapt to throughWords as well, for future enhancement VoiceCode
Quintijn August, 2009
  load( selectWords=['Select'], throughWord='Through', throughWords=None, allResults=0, hypothesis=0 )
      selectWords is a list of words or phrases which can introduce a
          comand of this type.  For example, you can pass in a list like
          ['Select','Correct','Insert Before','Insert After'] to simulate
          some of NatSpeak's behavior.
      throughWord is a single word which is used between the two parts of
          the command as in "Select <text> Through <text>".  Pass in None
          or an empty string to disable two part commands.
      allResults=1 will make it so this grammar see every recognition
          result even if it is for another grammar,
      hypothesis=1 means that the gotHypothesis callback will be made.
          Otherwise, that callback is not made to avoid too much overhead.

  unload()
      Unload reset the state of the grammar.  Any SAPI objects will be
      freed and all callbacks will be terminated.

You need to activate the grammar before it can be recognized.  Activation
of a dictation grammar is simplier than a command grammar because there

          whose window handle is X is the foreground window.  This is
          the normal case.  Use window=0 to activate a global rule.

  deactivate()
      Deactivates the grammar.

  setExclusive( exclusive ):
      Set or reset the exclusive flag for this grammar (see comments under
      activate method of GrammarBase).

Selection gramars work on a text buffer which you pass to the grammar.
The speech recognition engine maintains a copy of this text and performs
all selection on its copy.  Then when the grammar is recognized, you can
find out the range of text which is effected.

  setSelectText(text)
      Pass in a block of text (string).

  getSelectText()
      Returns the text buffer contents currently stored in the speech
      recognition engine.

Derived classes should defined callback functions if they want recognition
results.  The following callback functions can be defined:

  gotResults( words, start, end )
      called when results are available for this grammar.

      words = list of recognized words; the first word will be one of
          the words or phrases in selectWords (passed in when the grammar
          was created).
      start = index into getSelectText of the start of the selection
      end = index into getSelectText of the end of the selection

  gotHypothesis( words )

      contains the partial recognition hypothesis during recognition.
