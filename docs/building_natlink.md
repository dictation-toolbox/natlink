# Compiling Instructions

When you want to contribute to the Natlink development, you will need to
compile the C++ code and compile the inno setup program. Try the
instructions below.

### Setup Visual Studio Code Environment

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.10.x 32-bit/X86 (Does not need to be on path) 

2. Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
   (Community Edition 2019 or above) with `C++ Desktop Development` and
   `Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable`.
   
   - [C++ Desktop Development](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/ide/using-the-visual-studio-ide-for-cpp-desktop-development) compilers for **(Visual Studio** and **Visual Studio Code)**
   - [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 14.40.33816.0 (recommended) or above](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) (32-bit/X86 required)

3. Install[cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) v3.31.0 (recommended) or above
4. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
   with the following Extensions
   
   - [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
   - [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools)

5. Install [Inno](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) version 6.x. - 
   - Inno Setup compiler iscc.exe needs to be sys PATH.
6. Install flit to Python 3.10.x 32-bit interpreter `py -3.10-32 -m pip install flit`
   
### Building Natlink

1. After cloning Natlink open the project up in Visual Studio Code
   - Set the Python Version `PYTHON_VERSION` in [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/natlink/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) in top directory of the project
   - example for Python 3.10.x `set(PYTHON_VERSION 3.10 CACHE STRING "3.X for X >= 10")`

2. Selective equivalent to`Visual Studio Community 2022 Release - x86` (32-bit/X86 required) to configure the compiler.

3. The `build` directory will generate containing the configuration
   selected and build artifacts (compiled code and installer)
   
   - The `build` directory can be safely deleted if you need to
     reconfigure the project as it will just regenerate.

4. Click the `build` button at the bottom of the editor to to build
   the project and create the installer.
   
   - ![build](/images/build.png)
5. The installer will appear as `\build\InstallerSource\natlinkX.X-pyY.Y-32-setup.exe` The installer executable is self-contained and may be distributed.

## Compiling FAQ

### How do I check for statically compiled C++ dependencies?

Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable must be statically compiled. If not this can cause issues during runtime. Utilize `dumpbin.exe` to check if `VCRUNTIME140D.dll` Is listed as a dependency for the .pyd. See [this issue](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/natlink/issues/86#issuecomment-1065217999) for a detailed explanation and walk-through

1. Make sure [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 32 bit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) is installed

2. Delete the `build` directory

3. Recompile

### How do I update after compilation or python edit?

If you have a natlink installed, and just wish to update the .pyd new `_natlink_core*.pyd` and `__init__.py`, run the powershell scripts `local_publish.ps1` in and administrative powershell to update. 

If you wish a different install location or pyd, pleasee copy `local_publish.ps1` to a script update_natlink.ps1 and make edits.  `update_natlink1.ps1` is in `.gitignore` so it won't be checked in to git.
