Install instructions for Natlink
===================================

- Install Dragon NaturallySpeaking

- Optional: install Python 3.10 (32 bit required) for your user and do not add to path. This will also be done, if necessary, when you run the installer program, but the path where python is installed may be less convenient.

- Download and run the latest [Natlink installer](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/natlink/releases): choose the most recent release, at the top of the page, and then scroll down and choose the file natlink?.?.?-py3.10-32-setup.exe. 

- As last step of the install procedure, the program `natlinkconfig_gui` is started. When you want to run this program later (again), type the program name at the Windows start program prompt.


- When using 'dragonfly', 'vocola' and/or 'unimacro', these packages are installed via `pip` with the config program. When you need other packages, you can  install these with pip.

- Then start Dragon, the 'Messages from Natlink' window should show up.

- See configure Natlink for more details.

- Also see [installation instructions](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/natlink/) (scroll down a bit...)
